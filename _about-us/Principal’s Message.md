# **Principal’s Message**

Welcome to Xinmin Primary School.

On behalf of my staff, we look forward to partnering the community in nurturing our Xinminites’ hearts and minds for a changing world.

With the resumption of activities towards a COVID-19 endemic status, we strive to equip our Xinminites with the right dispositions and skills to navigate and adapt to the changing norms. In alignment with our school’s vision, ‘Every xinminite, a confident citizen of character, ready for the future’, we will be implementing experiences that develop our Xinminites to be Lifelong Learners, Confident Leaders and Innovative Collaborators and these learners could be further unpacked with the following attributes:

·      A Lifelong Learner who is curious, receptive to new ideas (open-mindedness), takes responsibilities of his/her learning (with pride) to improve himself/ herself.

·      A Confident Leader who has the moral courage to distinguish right from wrong, acts on them and contributes actively in class/ school/ community.

·      An Innovative Collaborator who works well with others, adaptable to changing circumstances and resilient in overcoming challenges.

Xinmin Primary will continue to leverage on our Learning for Life Programme, CLOVE (**C**ultivating a **L**ife **O**f **V**alues and **E**xcellence), which anchors strongly on our core values of **Care, Respect, Responsible and Resilience**. Our team of educators will build Xinmin Primary to be a caring and supportive environment, which allows our Xinminites to discover their passions and purposes in learning. Xinmin Primary shall continue to be a place that allows them to express their curiosity and creativity and yet learn to be empathic and respectful as they work with their peers and teachers to hone their knowledge in the various subject disciplines and develop good values and characters.

With climate change being one of the key concerns that Singapore and many other countries will have to contend with, we will continue to inculcate in our Xinminites the importance of protecting our Mother Earth and building a future in which nature and people can thrive together. Thus, we will continue to partner learning institutions in Global Sustainable Development Programme as part of our Applied Learning Programme, GLOBE (**G**reen **L**ifestyle **O**bserved **B**y **E**veryone).

Our progress and achievements would not have been possible without the support of the entire Xinmin community: our parents, Parent Support Group, School Advisory Committee and community partners. Let us continue to work together to bring out the best in our Xinminites’ holistic development through our guidance and provision of opportunities as we prepare them for life.

Welcome to Xinmin Primary School. 

On behalf of my staff, we look forward to partnering the community in nurturing our Xinminites’ hearts and minds for a changing world.

In Xinmin Primary School, we strive to equip our Xinminites with the right dispositions and skills to navigate and adapt to the changing norms. In alignment with our school’s vision, ‘Every Xinminite, a confident citizen of character, ready for the future’, we will be implementing experiences that develop our Xinminites to be Lifelong Learners, Confident Leaders and Innovative Collaborators and these learners could be further unpacked with the following attributes:

•	A Lifelong Learner who is curious, receptive to new ideas (open-mindedness), takes responsibilities of his/her learning (with pride) to improve himself/ herself.

•	A Confident Leader who has the moral courage to distinguish right from wrong, acts on them and contributes actively in class/ school/ community.

•	An Innovative Collaborator who works well with others, adaptable to changing circumstances and resilient in overcoming challenges.

Xinmin Primary will continue to leverage on our Learning for Life Programme, CLOVE (**C**ultivating a **L**ife Of **V**alues and **E**xcellence), which anchors strongly on our core values of** Care, Respect, Responsible and Resilience**. Our team of educators will build Xinmin Primary to be a caring and supportive environment, which allows our Xinminites to discover their passions and purposes in learning. Xinmin Primary shall continue to be a place that allows them to express their curiosity and creativity and yet learn to be empathic and respectful as they work with their peers and teachers to hone their knowledge in the various subject disciplines and develop good values and characters.

With climate change being one of the key concerns that Singapore and many other countries will have to contend with, we will continue to inculcate in our Xinminites the importance of protecting our Mother Earth and building a future in which nature and people can thrive together. Thus, we will continue to partner learning institutions in Global Sustainable Development Programme as part of our Applied Learning Programme, GLOBE (**G**reen **L**ifestyle **O**bserved By **E**veryone). 

For these few upcoming years, we look forward to developing sustainable partnerships with external organisations which will value-add to our Xinminites and staff learning experiences. We are happy to collaborate with overseas educational institutions in WuXi, China, and local partners like Gardens by the Bay and our Resident Network in Hougang Constituency which will enhance our Xinminites’ developments in realizing the attributes needed in the future. 

Our progress and achievements would not have been possible without the support of the entire Xinmin community: our parents, Parent Support Group, School Advisory Committee and community partners. Let us continue to work together to bring out the best in our Xinminites’ holistic development through our guidance and provision of opportunities as we prepare them for life.
