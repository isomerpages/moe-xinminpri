<h1><strong>Principal’s Message</strong></h1>
<p>It is with great excitement and enthusiasm that I extend a warm welcome
to everyone as we embark on another enriching school year. At Xinmin Primary,
we are committed to developing our students into Lifelong Learners, Confident
Leaders, and Innovative Collaborators who are prepared to thrive in an
ever-changing world.</p>
<p>Our school’s signature Learning for Life Programme, <strong>CLOVE</strong> (<strong>C</strong>ultivating
a <strong>L</strong>ife <strong>O</strong>f <strong>V</strong>alues and <strong>E</strong>xcellence)
and Applied Learning Programme, <strong>GLOBE</strong> (<strong><u>G</u></strong>reen <strong><u>L</u></strong>ifestyle <strong><u>O</u></strong>bserved <strong><u>B</u></strong>y <strong><u>E</u></strong>veryone),
are at the heart of our approach to education. Through our customised experiential
activities, we provide opportunities for our students to explore, create,
and challenge themselves in real-world contexts. These experiences are
designed not only to build their knowledge and skills but to cultivate
critical dispositions that are essential for their growth. We are proud
to foster a learning environment where curiosity is encouraged, leadership
is nurtured, and collaboration becomes second nature.</p>
<p>As we continue our journey into the 21st century, we are deeply committed
to equipping our students with the Emerging 21st Century Competencies that
will empower them to navigate the complexities of the Volatile, Uncertain,
Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA) world. By focusing on shaping their mindsets
and building the necessary skillsets, we are preparing them to be adaptable,
resilient, and forward-thinking individuals who will make a positive impact
in our community.</p>
<p>In addition to the rich learning experiences within our classrooms, we
are strengthening our partnerships with overseas educational institutions
in WuXi, China, and local partners like Gardens by the Bay, City Sprouts
and our Resident Network in Hougang Constituency. These collaborations
are integral to enhancing both our students’ and staff’s learning experiences.
Through these partnerships, we are able to offer new perspectives, resources,
and opportunities that will further enrich the development of our Xinminites.</p>
<p>As always, we are grateful for the unwavering support of our parents,
Parent Support Group, School Advisory Committee and community partners.
Together, we form a strong, united force that ensures our Xinminites have
the conducive environment for their education and growth. We look forward
to another year of growth, learning, and success for all.</p>
<p>Let us continue to work hand in hand to develop the Learners, Leaders
and Collaborators of tomorrow.</p>
