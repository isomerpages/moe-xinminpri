<h1><strong>Principal’s Message</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Xinmin Family,</p>
<p>As we step into 2026, I am delighted to share with you an exciting new
chapter in our school's journey. After thoughtful reflection and extensive
consultation with our community, we have refreshed our school's vision,
mission, and values to better prepare our Xinminites (our students) in
an ever-evolving world.</p>
<p><u>Our New Direction</u>
</p>
<p>Our renewed vision, "<strong>Every Xinminite, anchored in values, ready for the future</strong>,"
captures our unwavering commitment to developing students who are not only
academically capable but also morally grounded and future-ready. This vision
is brought to life through our mission: "<strong>Nurturing Xinminites to Learn, Lead and Collaborate</strong>,"
supported by our five core values of <strong>Integrity, Care, Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience</strong>.</p>
<p>This revamp reflects our deep understanding that as educators, we must
ensure our Xinminites are firmly anchored in society-accepted values whilst
being confident to navigate the complexities of our VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain,
Complex, Ambiguous) and BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Non-linear, Incomprehensible)
world. Through authentic and engaging learning experiences, we are committed
to enhancing their holistic development across the Emerging 21st Century
Competencies (E21CC) framework.</p>
<p><u>Developing Future-Ready Learners</u>
</p>
<p>Our focus centres on cultivating essential Learning Dispositions that
will serve our Xinminites throughout their lives. We are nurturing Xinminites
to<strong> Learn</strong> by fostering curiosity, encouraging them to take
responsibility for their learning experiences, and developing their adaptability.
We are empowering them to <strong>Lead</strong> through perseverance and
moral courage, whilst teaching them to <strong>Collaborate</strong> with
open-mindedness and empathy.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we are equipping our dedicated staff to embrace P3I dispositions—being<strong> Passionate </strong>about
their profession, <strong>Inquisitive </strong>in their approach, <strong>Innovative</strong> in
their methods, and <strong>Inclusive</strong> in their daily responsibilities.
This ensures that our educators are well-prepared to guide and inspire
our students effectively.</p>
<p><u>The Power of Partnership</u>
</p>
<p>The development of our Xinminites' E21 CC and the amplification of student
voices cannot be achieved by the school alone. I am deeply grateful for
the continued partnership with our parents, Parent Support Group (PSG),
School Advisory Committee (SAC), and community partners. Your collaboration
enables us to create meaningful opportunities for our Xinminites to contribute
their unique strengths and passions to their communities, fostering a sense
of purpose and civic responsibility.</p>
<p><u>Looking Ahead</u>
</p>
<p>Together as a team, I believe we will build a strong foundation for our
Xinminites to realise their full potential and be truly ready for their
future—always anchored in values. The journey ahead is one of growth, discovery,
and transformation, and I am confident that with our collective commitment
and support, every Xinminite will thrive.</p>
<p>Thank you for your unwavering support and partnership as we embark on
this meaningful journey together. Here's to a year of growth, learning,
and success for all our Xinminites.</p>
<p>With appreciation,</p>
<p>Mrs Judy Lim</p>
<p>Principal, Xinmin Primary School</p>
