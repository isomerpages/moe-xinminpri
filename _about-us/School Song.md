# **School Song**

Xinmin, Xinmin, always aim for excellence.

We strive hard to succeed, what we say we’ll do.

Let’s march onward to a better future,

In Word and Deed, we will ever grow.

Best foot forward, let’s advance together,

In Word and Deed, we will stronger grow.

Xinmin, Xinmin, count on us to do our best.

We’ll bring you great honour for ever more.
