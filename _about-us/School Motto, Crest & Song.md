# School Motto

 In Word and Deed

# **School Crest**

![](/images/sch_crest.png)

The badge is designed with the traditional shield and with the name of the school on top and the motto supporting it. The open book signifies honesty and openness towards knowledge. The flames represent students’ holistic development in the Cognitive, Physical, Aesthetics, Social and Moral domains.

# **School Song**

Xinmin, Xinmin, always aim for excellence.

We strive hard to succeed, what we say we’ll do.

Let’s march onward to a better future,

In Word and Deed, we will ever grow.

Best foot forward, let’s advance together,

In Word and Deed, we will stronger grow.

Xinmin, Xinmin, count on us to do our best.

We’ll bring you great honour for ever more.
