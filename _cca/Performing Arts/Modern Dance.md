# **Modern Dance**


The Xinmin Dance Crew aims to provide dancers with a fun and dynamic way to express themselves through movement. 

**MISSION**

•	To nurture each dancer’s aesthetic talents, to his/her fullest potential.
•	To instill discipline, build confidence and resilience in our dancers.
•	To develop a love and an appreciation for dance.

In our CCA, dancers learn a variety of dance styles and techniques, including contemporary, jazz, and hip hop. Our curriculum is designed to be both challenging and enjoyable, with a focus on developing coordination, flexibility, and strength. 

Through dance, students develop a sense of rhythm through the dance techniques and inculcate the values of discipline and perseverance. Participation in modern dance fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation. 

**DANCE TRAINING**

*Innovative Collaborators*

Our experienced dance instructors are passionate about teaching the art of modern dance and, fostering creativity and self-expression in every student. Dancers learn from the professionals in the dance industry. Platforms for innovative collaboration are created during practice sessions which allow students to think on their feet and choreograph new dance sequences within their own groups.
Confident Leaders
Open to Primary 4 to Primary 6 students who have an interest in dancing, dancers are given opportunities to develop leadership skills and inculcate personal qualities such as responsibility and perseverance.

**KEY PROGRAMMES**

**Service to School and the Community**

Our dancers are active in the participation of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and concerts performance for various school events and outreach programmes. In addition to regular dance practices, our CCA also offers opportunities for students to perform and showcase their skills, bringing joy to the public as they watch the performances.

The highlight of the year is the Recognition Day Concert at the end of the year. Our dancers also performed in the Performing HeARTS concerts in 2019 and 2023, Xinmin Primary School’s biannual concert, which provides students with a chance to shine on stage and to share their hard work and dedication with their family members.
