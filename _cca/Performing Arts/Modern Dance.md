# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

The Xinmin Dance Crew [XMDC] aims to provide dancers with a fun and dynamic way to express themselves through movement. 

# **Mission**

* To nurture each dancer’s aesthetic talents, to his/her fullest potential.
* To instill discipline, build confidence and resilience in our dancers.
* To develop a love and an appreciation for dance.

In our CCA, dancers learn a variety of dance styles and techniques, including contemporary, jazz, and hip hop. Our curriculum is designed to be both challenging and enjoyable, with a focus on developing coordination, flexibility, and strength. 

Through dance, students develop a sense of rhythm through dance techniques and inculcate the values of discipline and perseverance. Participation in modern dance fosters social integration, deepens commitment and cultivates students' sense of belonging and responsibility to school, community and nation.

### **Dance Training**

_Innovative Collaborators_

Our experienced dance instructors are passionate about teaching the art of modern dance and fostering creativity and self-expression in every student. Dancers learn from professionals in the dance industry. Platforms for innovative collaboration are created during practice sessions, allowing students to think on their feet and choreograph new dance sequences within their groups.

_Confident Leaders_

Open to Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who have an interest in dancing, members are given opportunities to develop leadership skills and cultivate personal qualities such as responsibility and perseverance.

Through our comprehensive dance programme, students not only master the technical aspects of modern dance but also emerge as confident, creative individuals ready to take on leadership roles in their communities.


# **Key Programmes:**

### **Service to School and the Community**

Our dancers actively participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), school events and outreach programmes. In addition to regular dance practices, our CCA offers opportunities for students to perform and showcase their skills, bringing joy to audiences through their performances.

The highlight of the year is the Recognition Day Concert. Our dancers have also performed in the Performing HeARTS concerts in 2019 and 2023, Xinmin Primary School's biennial showcase, which provides students with opportunities to shine on stage and share their dedication with family members.

At Xinmin Primary School, we believe that dance is an integral part of a well-rounded education. We are committed to providing our dancers with the best possible dance experience
