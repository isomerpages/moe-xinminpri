**_Why walk when you can dance?_**

**What is Dance?**

Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.

**A Brief History of Dance**

Modern dance is a broad genre of western concert or theatrical dance which included dance styles such as ballet, folk, ethnic, religious, and social dancing; and primarily arose out of Europe and the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was considered to have been developed as a rejection of, or rebellion against classical ballet, and also a way to express social concerns like socioeconomic and cultural factors.

In the late 19th century, modern dance artists such as Isadora Duncan, Maud Allan, and Loie Fuller were pioneering new forms and practices in what is now called aesthetic or free dance. These dancers disregarded ballet’s strict movement vocabulary (the particular, limited set of movements that were considered proper to ballet) and stopped wearing corsets and pointe shoes in the search for greater freedom of movement.

Modern dance has evolved with each subsequent generation of participating artists. Artistic content has morphed and shifted from one choreographer to another, as have styles and techniques. Artists such as Graham and Horton developed techniques in the Central Modern Period that are still taught worldwide and numerous other types of modern dance exist today. \[Source : Wikipedia\]

**International Dance CCA in Xinmin Primary School**

The International Dance CCA began in 2015 following the amalgamation of Malay Dance & Indian Dance CCAs.

The International Dance CCA aims to:

* Nurture the dancers’ aesthetic talents, each to their fullest potential.
* Instill discipline, build confidence and resilience in our dancers.
* Develop a love and an appreciation for dance.

Through dance, students develop a sense of rhythm through the dance techniques and inculcate the values of discipline and perseverance. Participation in modern dance fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation. Open to Primary 2 to Primary 6 students who have an interest in dancing, dancers are given opportunities to develop leadership skills and inculcate personal qualities such as responsibility and perseverance.

**Dance Training**

Students learn from the best trainers in the dance industry. Experienced external instructors are engaged to train the dancers.

**Service to School and the Community**

Our dancers are very active in the participation of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and concerts performance for various school events and outreach programmes. Apart from SYF, there were also many opportunities to  
perform for other schools events like Chinese New Year, National Day, Recognition Day concerts.

As part of our contribution to community, our dancers performed at the National Day celebration organised by the People’s Association in 2019.

Our dancers also performed in the Performing HeArts concerts in 2017 and 2019, Xinmin Primary School’s biannual concert, which allows parents of students in Performing Arts CCAs to appreciate & celebrate the long hours put in by their children in their respective CCAs.
