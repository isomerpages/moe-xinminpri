# **Mission &amp; Key Programmes:**


# **Mission**  

* To cultivate mental, emotional and musical growth through singing
* To develop confident leaders through performances
* To nurture innovative collaborators with a deep appreciation for music

The Xinmin Primary School Choir, also known as Xinmin Nightingales, provides a platform for passionate young singers to come together as an ensemble and create beautiful music. Under the baton of Mr Marcus Lee, the Xinmin Nightingales refine their musicianship by developing essential singing skills such as voice projection, pitch accuracy and rhythmic sense. Through engaging activities like body percussion and rhythm games, choir members enhance their musical abilities while enjoying a fun and enriching learning experience.

Anchored in our school's core values of Care, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience, students grow to sing with confidence while developing an appreciation for choral music through exposure to a diverse repertoire of songs.

# **Key Programmes**  

Beyond regular rehearsals, the Xinmin Nightingales actively showcase their talents at various school, community and national events. Signature performances include:

* Annual Recognition Day Concert
* Biennial Performing HeArts Concert

In addition, they participate in school, community and national events, where every performance—regardless of scale—serves as an opportunity to build confidence and strive for excellence. Through their choir journey, students also learn to collaborate innovatively by:

* Engaging in choir exchanges with other school choirs
* Using movements and props to bring their songs to life

These experiences not only enhance their musical skills but also foster teamwork, creativity and a deep passion for singing.
