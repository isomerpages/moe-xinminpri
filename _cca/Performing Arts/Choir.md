# **Choir**
### Mission  

1) To cultivate mental, emotional and musical growth through singing.
2) To develop confident leaders through performances.
3) To nurture innovative collaborators with a keen appreciation for music.
4) To build a choral sound of our own and strive towards making music with excellence


Also known as Xinmin Nightingales, the Xinmin Primary School Choir provides a platform for passionate children who enjoy singing, to come together as an ensemble to make beautiful music. Under the baton of Mr Marcus Lee, Xinmin Nightingales will learn to improve their musicianship through singing skills such as voice projection and pitching, and rhythmic sense through body percussion and rhythm games throughout their choir journey. Anchored in our schoolâ€™s core values of Care, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience, students will also grow to sing with confidence as they develop an appreciation for choral music through exposure to a vast repertoire of songs. 

Aside from our annual Recognition Day Concert and biennial Performing HeArts Concert, Xinmin Nightingales has actively participated for various school, community and national events. Every performance, regardless of size, is an opportunity for our Nightingales to build confidence and in their quest for singing with excellence, students will also learn to collaborate innovatively through singing together with other school choirs, and also using movements and props to bring their songs alive.
