At Xinmin Primary Guzheng Ensemble, students acquire foundational skills before progressing to play various genres of music once they master the basic playing techniques. Through training sessions, students understand the importance of teamwork and learn to collaborate with others to create music together. The ensemble has worked hard towards excellence over the years and has developed strong bonds among its members.

During their time in Xinmin Primary Guzheng Ensemble, students are exposed to traditional Chinese music pieces, Mandopop medleys and English pop songs.

Students receive numerous opportunities to showcase their learning. In 2023, the ensemble actively participated in various school events, including the biennial Performing HeArts concert, CCA in-house showcase, P6 Appreciation Day and Recognition Day concert. In 2024, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival and attained the prestigious Distinction award.

Xinmin Primary Guzheng Ensemble offers students a comprehensive musical journey, providing a nurturing environment for them to grow as musicians, collaborators and performers, thereby enriching their holistic development.
