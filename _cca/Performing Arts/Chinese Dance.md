# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

# **Mission**

* To cultivate mental, emotional and musical growth through dance
* To nurture confident individuals through mastery of dance skills and successful performances
* To develop motivated lifelong learners with a deep appreciation for dance
* To foster teamwork and resilience through collaborative performances that serve the community

At Xinmin Primary School, our Chinese Dance CCA embraces a rich history and promotes inclusivity, regardless of students' cultural backgrounds. We provide a supportive and collaborative environment that nurtures cooperation by inviting our dancers to participate on various platforms and experience the beauty of dance. 

Our training is rooted in Chinese folk and classical dance, emphasising strong foundational techniques while encouraging artistic expression. Through bodily and facial movements, dancers learn to convey emotions with grace and precision. Rigorous training not only refines their dance techniques but also enhances their focus, discipline and creativity, contributing to their mental and emotional growth. Furthermore, the deep connection between dance and music nurtures a profound sense of musicality, enriching their overall artistic journey.

Our Chinese dancers actively perform at various school events, including:

* CCA in-house Showcase
* P6 Appreciation Day
* Performing HeArts
* Recognition Day

Beyond school performances, they have showcased their talents at public events such as:

•	Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2024

•	Pinetree Yuan Xiao Celebration 2023

•	Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2022

•	HyperLive Festival Singapore 2022
