At Xinmin Primary School, our Chinese Dance CCA embraces a rich history and promotes inclusivity, regardless of their cultural background. We create an inclusive, collaborative and conducive environment that nurtures collaboration by inviting our dancers to participate at various platforms and experience the beauty of dance. Our training draws references from upon movements from Chinese Folk and classic dance and places emphasis on building a strong foundation in fostering artistic expression through the use of bodily and facial movements to convey emotions. Through rigorous training in Chinese dance, dancers undergo a profound personal growth process. They cultivate heightened focus, discipline, and the ability to express themselves creatively, leading to remarkable mental and emotional development. Furthermore, the intricate relationship between dance and music nurtures a profound sense of musicality, enhancing their overall artistic journey.

Our Chinese dancers actively participate in concert performances for various school events, such as CCA showcase, P6 Appreciation Day and Recognition Day.

Apart from that, we have also been involved in public performances, such as Singapore Youth Festival 2022,  HyperLive Festival Singapore in 2022, Pinetree Yuan Xiao Celebration in 2023 and Performing HeArts in 2023. We will also take part in Singapore Youth Festival this year.

Through such platforms, students collaborate innovatively in groups to serve the community by showing their talents while learning valuable lessons in resilience and teamwork. Beyond physical fitness, dance builds confidence and helps individuals overcome stage fright. At Xinmin Primary School, we are dedicated to promoting Chinese Arts and elevating their prestige in today's society.
