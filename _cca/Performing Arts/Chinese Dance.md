# **Chinese Dance**

### Mission and Key Programs

At Xinmin Primary School, our Chinese Dance CCA embraces a rich history and promotes inclusivity, regardless of their cultural background. We create a passionate and innovative atmosphere that nurtures inquisitive students, inviting them to participate in and experience the beauty of dance. Our dance training draws upon movements from Chinese Folk and classic dance, placing emphasis on building a strong foundation and fostering artistic expression through the use of bodily and facial movements to convey emotions.

Our Chinese dancers are very active in the participation of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and concerts performance for various school events, such as CCA showcase and school recognition day concert.

Apart from the SYF, our Chinese dance members have been actively involved in public performances. We took part in National Day dinner organised by Ang Mo Kio-Hougang GROs in 2016 in which Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong had been invited as the guest of honour. We participated in the Chinese Dance Fiesta in June 2020 at Esplanade. Moreover, we were invited to perform at the MediaCorp theatre for the hyperLive Festival Singapore in 2022. We also took part in Pinetree Yuan Xiao Celebration 2023, with the attendance of grassroots adviser Mr Darryl David. 

Through dance, students serve their community while also learning valuable lessons in resilience and teamwork. Beyond physical fitness, dance builds confidence and helps individuals overcome fears. At Xinmin Primary School, we are dedicated to promoting Chinese Arts and elevating their prestige in today's society.
