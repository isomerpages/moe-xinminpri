# **Chinese Dance**

![](/images/Esplanade-Performance-1.jpg)

Xinmin Primary School’s Chinese Dance is a CCA with a rich history. We accept both Chinese and non-Chinese students. We adopt dance movements from Chinese Folk and classic dance, which emphasise the establishment of a solid foundation and the development of artistic expression, by conveying emotions using the body and facial expressions.

Our Chinese Dance students have been actively participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and performing in school concerts for various school events.

Apart from the SYF, our Chinese dance members have been actively involved in public performances. We took part in National Day dinner organised by Ang Mo Kio-Hougang GROs in 2016 in which Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong had been invited as the guest of honour. We also took part in the Chinese Dance Fiesta in June 2020 in Esplanade.

Through dance, students are able to serve the community and learn the values of resilience and teamwork. Dance is not just helping a dancer maintain physical fitness, but also cultivating one’s confidence and overcoming fears. We hope our members will continue to raise the prestige of Chinese Arts in this modern society.
