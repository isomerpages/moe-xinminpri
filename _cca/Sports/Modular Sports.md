# **Modular Sports**

Modular Sports aims to expose students to a variety of sports at a recreational level. Over the course of three years in the CCA, members will gain theoretical knowledge of different sports as well as pick up new sports skills. They will also be instilled with the values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience through the numerous individual and team activities they will participate in. In addition to these, members are inculcated with the values of teamwork and good sportsmanship.
