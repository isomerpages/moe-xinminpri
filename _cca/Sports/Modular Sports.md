# **Mission:**

Igniting Passion for Sports and Fostering Team Spirit
Modular Sports aims to expose students to a variety of sports at a recreational level. Over the course of three years in the CCA, members will gain theoretical knowledge of different sports and learn the skills of each sport and apply them to the actual or modified games. 

Modular Sports members will be instilled with the values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience through the numerous individual and team activities they will participate in. In addition to these, they will be inculcated with the values of teamwork and good sportsmanship. 

Equipped with the knowledge and skills to play a variety of sports, students develop their passion for life-long participation in sports and other physical activities with a core emphasis on fair play and team spirit.
