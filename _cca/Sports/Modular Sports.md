# **Mission:**

Igniting Passion for Sports and Fostering Team Spirit

Modular Sports aims to expose students to a variety of sports at a recreational level. Over the course of their years in the CCA, members gain theoretical knowledge of different sports, learn specific skills and apply them in actual or modified games.

Through participation in various individual and team activities, Modular Sports members develop values such as care, respect, responsibility and resilience. They also learn the importance of teamwork and good sportsmanship.

Equipped with knowledge and skills across various sports, students develop a passion for lifelong participation in sports and physical activities, with an emphasis on fair play and team spirit.
