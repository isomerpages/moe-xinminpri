Football is offered to students who show a keen interest in the game and wishes to develop themselves in the technical aspects of the game. These young footballers are taught fundamental football skills such as passing and receiving, shooting as well as basic tactical knowledge in attacking and defending.

Xinmin Primary Football CCA aims to develop our footballers not only in physical skills but also in life skills and character building. Through the various activities, we want to instil the school’s core values of Care, Respect, Resilience and Responsibility and develop the 21st CC competencies in the footballers.

The CCA is well supported by a group of dedicated teachers and coaches. One of the main strengths of the CCA is the smaller coaches to players ratio, which means players’ development on and off the field are well optimised.

With the launching of the Unleash-the-Roar project by Football Association of Singapore, the Football CCA hopes to contribute directly or indirectly towards the success of this national project. With an age-appropriate program in place, we believe we are on the right track!
