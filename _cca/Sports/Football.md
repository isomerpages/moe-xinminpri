# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

# **Mission:**

To inculcate sportsmanship and a passion for football in student-athletes.

Football CCA in Xinmin develops our student-athletes to be lifelong learners, innovative collaborators and confident leaders:

* 3E CCA Development Tier: Xinmin Primary School's Football CCA programme follows the school's 3E (Expose, Extend and Excel) approach in developing students' technical skills and character. Regardless of which 3E tier students are in, they will learn basic and advanced football skills and develop positive values, with the hope that they will continue playing the game in their recreational time and remain physically active for life.

* National School Games: Every year, Xinmin Primary sends its Senior and Junior teams to participate in the annual National School Games. We believe that the spirit of participation is more important than the outcome of the matches. No matter the results, students are expected to demonstrate the school values of Care, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience. This platform also allows our team captains to display their leadership skills in guiding their teammates through both victories and setbacks.

* Inter-School Friendly Matches: We also organise friendly matches with other schools to provide students with opportunities to engage with peers, enhance their football skills and further develop their leadership abilities.
