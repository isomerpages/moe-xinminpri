### Vision:

Developing well-rounded student athletes through football

### Mission:

Inculcating in students-athletes, teamwork, sportsmanship and the passion for football

Football CCA in Xinmin focus on these programs to develop our student-athletes to be lifelong learners, innovative collaborators and confident leaders:

•	3E CCA Program: Xinmin Primary School Football CCA program follows the school’s 3E approach which are Expose, Extend and Excel categories. Regardless of which category that the students are in, they learn basic and advanced football skills with the hope that they will carry on playing the game in their recreational time. This is in line with the school’s Learners’ Vision Outcome of being a Lifelong Learner.

•	Partnership with Sports Singapore for our coaching sessions: Our coaching sessions are conducted with coaches from Active Sg Football Academy as part of our Schools Sports Partnership with Sports Singapore. Under this collaboration, students will also focus on values through football such resilience, sportsmanship and teamwork which will bring out the spirit of innovative collaboration and develop them as confident leaders.

•	National School Games: Every year, Xinmin Primary would send the Senior and Junior team to participate in the annual National School Games. We believe that the spirit of participating is more important than the outcome of the matches. No matter the results, students are expected to show the school values of Care, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience. This is also the platform for our team captains to display their confident leadership to lead players in good and bad times.

•	Inter-School Friendly Games: As much as possible, we would arrange friendly games with other schools to expose the students and provide them with an opportunity to learn from other schools and further develop their football skills.
