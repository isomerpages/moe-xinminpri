# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

Through our customized trainings, we hope to instill in all basketball members the school core values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience and to develop a strong team of basketball members who is firmly grounded in basketball skills such as ball-handling, shooting and defense, and be physically and emotionally fit to face challenges.

Through this CCA, students can forge friendships and strong camaraderie with their peers as they will go through competitions such as the annual North Zone Primary Schools Basketball Championships and the North Zone cluster games.
