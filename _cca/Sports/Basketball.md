<h1><strong>Mission &amp; Key Programmes:</strong></h1>
<p>Through our customised trainings, we hope to instil in all basketball
members the school core values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience
and to develop a strong team of basketball members who is firmly grounded
in basketball skills such as ball-handling, shooting and defense, and be
physically and emotionally fit to face challenges.</p>
<p>Through this CCA, students can forge friendships and strong camaraderie
with their peers as they will go through competitions such as the annual
North Zone Primary Schools Basketball Championships, the North Zone cluster
games and friendly matches with other schools.</p>
