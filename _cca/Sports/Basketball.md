### CCA Mission & Key Programmes:

Through rigorous trainings which hone their bodies, hearts and minds, we hope to instill in all Basketball members the lasting values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience. Our vision is to develop a strong team of Basketball members who are firmly grounded in skill, mental as well as physical fitness.

In addition, students are able to forge friendships and strong camaraderie with peers through competitions such as the annual North Zone Primary Schools Basketball Championships and the North Zone cluster games, which will hopefully resume once we overcome the current pandemic.

Above all, we emphasize to students that values and integrity are the most important traits that they have to possess.
