<h1><strong>Mission &amp; Key Programmes:</strong></h1>
<p>Through our customised training, we hope to instil in all basketball members
the school core values of care, respect, responsibility and resilience,
and to develop a strong team of basketball players who are firmly grounded
in basketball skills such as ball-handling, shooting and defence, and are
physically and emotionally fit to face challenges.</p>
<p>Through this CCA, students can forge friendships and strong camaraderie
with their peers as they participate in competitions such as the annual
National School Games and friendly matches with other schools.</p>
