# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

Volleyball CCA in Xinmin Primary School aims to impart the necessary volleyball skills and mould our students to be resilient individuals as lifelong learners.

While the development of individual skills is important, we also aim to develop our Xinminites’ collaboration skills during trainings and competitions. Besides emphasizing the importance of school core values, we also focus on tenacity, sportsmanship and respect.

Although our players join the sport with the differences in ability, they learn the importance of being a collaborator while they work together as a team in pursuit of a common goal. These values cultivated through the sport help players build and shape their character to be a good team player.
