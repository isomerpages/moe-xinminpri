# **Volleyball**

### CCA Mission & Key Programmes:

Volleyball CCA in Xinmin Primary School aims to impart technical volleyball skills to our players that can be used as transferrable skills in the future, with an outcome of being a Lifelong Learner.

Although it is a specialized discipline, the passionate Volleyball team at Xinmin Primary School welcomes and encourages students of varying abilities and talents. 

While the development of individual skills is important, we also aim to develop our Xinminites’ communication and collaboration skills during trainings and competitions. We emphasize the importance of Values in Sports where our players focuses on tenacity, sportsmanship and respect.

With the differences in ability, our players learn the importance of being an Innovative Collaborator while they work together and be resilient as a team in pursuit of a common goal. These values cultivated through the sport help build and shape their character to be a Confident Leader and instill a sense of determination and drive for success in all aspects of life.
