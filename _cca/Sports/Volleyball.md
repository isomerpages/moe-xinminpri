# **Mission & Key Programmes:**


Volleyball CCA in Xinmin Primary School aims to impart necessary volleyball skills and mould our students into resilient, lifelong learners.

While the development of individual skills is important, we also aim to develop our Xinminites' collaboration skills during training and competitions. Besides emphasising the importance of school core values, we also focus on tenacity, sportsmanship and respect.

Although our players join the sport with different abilities, they learn the importance of collaboration while working together as a team in pursuit of common goals. These values, cultivated through the sport, help players build and shape their character to become good team players.
