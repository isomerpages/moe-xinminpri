# **Modular CCA – P3**

Modular CCAs is a programme for P3 students on Fridays as part of their holistic education. The students will be participating in 3 different activities over the duration of a year. This will form part of the experimentation to some of the CCAs that will be offered when the students are in Primary 4 onwards.

The MCCA sessions will be held on Fridays from 7.30 to 9.00 am during curriculum time.  Hence, all students are expected to be enrolled in all the activities.  The MCCAs will be held within the school premises except for the Swim Safer Programme which will be held at Hougang Swimming Complex.

### Swim Safer Programme

SwimSafer is a national water safety programme introduced by the [National Water Safety Council (NWSC)](http://www.swimsingapore.com/national-water-safety-council). It combines both the National Survival Swimming Award (NASSA) and the Learn-To-Swim Programme (LTSP) into a progressive six-stage programme.

The objective of this programme is for your child to gain confidence and develop independence in the water, as well as learn general and deep-end water safety. Techniques taught includes forward and backward movement, safe entry and exit, and introduction to personal water survival skills.

### Coding

Primary 3 students were given the opportunity to pick up basic coding skills on the Scratch platform spanning 7 sessions of 1.5 hours each during their modular CCA periods. This program melded both programming and mathematical concepts into a series of lessons that engaged students through the medium of game theory and design.

Incorporating higher order thinking skills like problem-solving and refining solutions into the teaching of game design, students are encouraged to come up with novel solutions to problems and parameters set for them in the various activities. This imparts a strong sense of curiosity and the essential principle that there are many possible solutions of varying degrees of effectiveness to a defined problem.

The students greatly enjoyed the use of laptops and the platform Scratch which was accessible and had a user-friendly graphical interface. Their game creations were shared with their peers and they also get a chance to go on a mini presentation on the principles behind the games they had created, using the skills and techniques they had acquired through the 7 sessions of the program. The students get to code their own interactive stories, animations, and games. In the process, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. These are the essential skills for everyone in today’s society with the focus on 21st century competencies.

All in all, the program successfully engaged the students and fostered both their inquisitiveness as well as their acquisition of crucial mathematical concepts that were applied in their game design.

### Hip Hop

Hip Hop is one of the most popular forms of dance because it’s fun and exciting. It improves coordination through movements. School has provided the opportunity for Primary 3 students to learn the basic Hip Hop dance steps this year. 7 sessions will be conducted during curriculum CCA periods from 8.30 to 9.30 on certain Fridays by qualified instructors.

Hip Hop is not only fun, it’s a natural stress reliever that can help your child improve their concentration skills. Studies have shown that children with a background in music and dance are more outgoing, it is definitely a great way to bring a shy child out of their shell and build confidence.

Most importantly, the school wants to establish a holistic education for the students’ well-being and achieve the joy of learning.
