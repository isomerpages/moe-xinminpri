# **Infocomm Technology Club**

## “Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.”
—Bill Gates, Co-Chairman, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Co-Founder, Microsoft


### Mission:
To instill the joy of logic-based coding and programming 

### Vision:
Every Infocomm Club member a logical problem solver

The Infocomm Club is a CCA for students who are passionate about coding. Students will develop critical thinking skills and creativity through the basics of coding on Scratch.

Our middle primary members will be equipped with knowledge to present stories or to create games online on Scratch before moving onto LEGO Spike Prime robotic sets in the second half of the year. They will learn to use block-based programming in both programmes which would ease the transition between the two.

Our upper primary members will continue to explore coding with LEGO Spike Prime programme. With their limitless imagination, they are able to build robots using sensors, motors and arms to carry out a variety of tasks such as navigating a drawn route or pick up items. Besides learning the skills to code efficiently, the students would develop resilience and logical thinking. Students get to apply concepts learnt in their mathematics and science lessons such as angles, light and speed while they code.

Through logic-based coding, students hone their logical reasoning as they get the robots to carry out tasks in a fun and meaningful way. They also work in groups and learn collaboratively with their peers. This gives them the opportunities to develop effective communication skills and become better team players.
