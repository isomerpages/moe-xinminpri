# **Art Club**
### Description

“Every artist was first an amateur.”

~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

Every talent begins with an interest. If a pupil has an interest in Art, then our club can help develop your skills. Our club aims to develop our pupil’s unique cognitive profile. Art Club members will learn to express their ideas, feelings and experiences through different art forms and medium.

The Art Club fosters the development of the whole child, including the cognitive, physical, social-emotional and creative domains. The Art Club members respond through their creative artwork. They are motivated to communicate ideas from their imagination, thoughts and feelings by exploring varied genres of art. The Art Club activities challenge members to do art through various techniques, medium and materials. Values such as teamwork, cooperation, responsibility, respect, care and resilience are incorporated in our activities. The Art Club builds its members’ confidences and skills to express themselves freely and creatively.

**Vision:**     
Every Xinminite an Artist

**Mission:**      
To ignite the interest in art through active art making, participation and sharing.
