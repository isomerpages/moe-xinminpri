# **Mission & Key Programmes**

# **Mission**  
Nurturing the Passion for the Visual Arts in every Xinminite, igniting the interest in art through art making.

The Art Club fosters the development of the whole child cognitively, physically, socially, emotionally and creatively. Members are exposed to various art forms and artworks of known artists to get ideas and inspiration. The exposure gives them opportunities to engage in active discussions via inquiry-based learning routines for them to communicate their ideas, thoughts and feelings.

As members are diverse in their dispositions, experiences and creative abilities, they learn to collaborate, adapt and adopt different approaches during art-making. By going through these experiences, the members can contribute to areas they are confident in and at the same time cultivate the values of respect and care for one another.

The Art Club activities challenge members to create art through various techniques, media and materials. While experiencing these, members are encouraged to stretch their imagination and creativity to maximise their potential. The Art Club hopes to build its members' confidence and artistic skills while developing them to be lifelong learners.

“Every artist was first an amateur.”

~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
