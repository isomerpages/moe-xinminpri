# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

### **XMPS ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS**

# **Mission**

•	To create awareness and personal responsibility within XMPS and the community.

•	To develop in our members environmentally-friendly and sustainable habits which translate into lifelong actions that seek to make our world a better place

•	To enable our members to learn more about biodiversity and strive to ‘Protect and Conserve our Biodiversity’

The Environmental Science Club, formerly known as the Eco-Green Club has been the driving force of the school’s eco-environment programmes to create awareness of environmental issues such as environment protection, conservation, preservation and restoration since 2019

Our CCA brings together students who are interested in

•	environmental advocacy and sustainability and

•	environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity

Students in the Environmental Science Club are empowered to promote environmentally-conscious activities among the general student population.  They are given opportunities to develop and demonstrate their leadership skills while educating fellow Xinminites on environmental issues. Some of the activities included:
