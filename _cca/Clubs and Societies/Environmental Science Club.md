# **Environmental Science Club**

The Environmental Science Club was first established in 2019, formerly known as the Eco-Green Club. Our club is the driving force of the school’s eco-environment programmes to create awareness of environmental issues, such as environment protection, conservation, preservation, and restoration.

Our CCA brings together students who are interested in:

*   environmental advocacy and sustainability
*   learning more about environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity, and etc.

### Mission

1.  To create awareness and personal responsibility within XMPS and the community
2.  To develop in our members environmentally friendly and sustainable habits which translate into lifelong actions that seek to make our world a better place
3.  To learn more about biodiversity and strive to ‘Protect and Conserve our Biodiversity’

Students in the Environmental Science Club will be empowered to promote environmentally conscious activities among the general student population. Members of the club will strive to provide leadership and education through these activities.
