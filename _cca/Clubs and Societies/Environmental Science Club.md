# ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE CLUB CCA
### XMPS ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS
The Environmental Science Club was first established in 2019, formerly known as the Eco-Green Club. Our club is the driving force of the school’s eco-environment programmes to create awareness of environmental issues such as environment protection, conservation, preservation and restoration.

Our CCA brings together students who are interested in:

•	environmental advocacy and sustainability

•	environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity

### Objectives
•	Create awareness and personal responsibility within XMPS and the community.

•	Develop in our members environmentally friendly and sustainable habits which translate into lifelong actions that seek to make our world a better place

•	Enable our members to learn more about biodiversity and strive to ‘Protect and Conserve our Biodiversity’

Students in the Environmental Science Club are empowered to promote environmentally-conscious activities among the general student population.  They are given opportunities to develop and demonstrate their leadership skills while educating fellow Xinminites on environmental issues.
