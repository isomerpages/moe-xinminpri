# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

### **XMPS ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS**

# **Mission**

* To create awareness and instill personal responsibility for the environment within XMPS and the wider community.

* To cultivate environmentally friendly and sustainable habits that translate into lifelong actions, making our world a better place.
* To enable our members to learn more about biodiversity and strive to ‘Protect and Conserve our Biodiversity’

The Environmental Science Club, formerly known as the Eco-Green Club, has been the driving force behind the school’s eco-environment initiatives since 2019. The club actively raises awareness of environmental issues, including protection, conservation, preservation and restoration efforts.

Our CCA brings together students who are passionate about:

* Environmental advocacy and sustainability
* Key environmental issues, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation

Students in the Environmental Science Club play a key role in promoting eco-friendly practices within the school community. They are given opportunities to develop leadership skills while educating their fellow Xinminites on pressing environmental issues. Some of the activities include:
