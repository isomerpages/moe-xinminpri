# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

Aligned with the Girl Guide movement, Brownies are nurtured with essential skills to adapt to the ever-changing demands of the world. The programme equips girls with valuable life skills that help shape their character and impact their lives positively.

Brownies have opportunities to participate in various competitions organised by Girl Guides Singapore (Headquarters). At Xinmin Primary School, the Brownies also collaborate with the North Division Guides to contribute their services to the community.

To instil empathy, Brownies engage in Service-Learning projects where they gain awareness of the challenges faced by others and play an active role in improving and transforming lives within the community.

Additionally, the Brownies work together with other Uniformed Groups, such as the Red Cross and Scouts, within Xinmin Primary School. Through these collaborations, they share and learn skills that can be applied across the different Uniformed Groups.
