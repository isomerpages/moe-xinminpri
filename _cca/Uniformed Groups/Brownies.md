**Mission & Key Programmes:**
      
Following the Girl Guide movement, Brownies are inculcated with the skills to cope with the ever-changing demands of the world. It teaches and equips girls with life-skills which in turn shapes the lives of many girls.

Brownies are given opportunities to participate in various competitions organised by the Girl Guide Singapore (Headquarters). Xinmin Brownies also partner with North Division Guides to contribute their services to the community. To instill the value of empathy, Brownies also participate in Service-Learning projects.  With such projects, the Brownies are made aware of the plight of others and play a part in improving and changing the lives of the community.
