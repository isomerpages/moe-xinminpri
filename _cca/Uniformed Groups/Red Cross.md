# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

Red Cross Youth provides a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Primary school units, known as 'Links', learn about universal humanitarian values advocated by the Singapore Red Cross Society.

The CCA creates opportunities for Links to develop leadership qualities, build character, and acquire essential Red Cross knowledge and basic foot drills.

Through weekly sessions, activities and competitions, members learn core values and develop social and emotional competencies.

Links have opportunities to contribute during Total Defence Day and represent the school at zonal and national events, competitions and camps organised by Singapore Red Cross Society Headquarters.
