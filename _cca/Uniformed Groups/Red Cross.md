# **Red Cross**
In line with the mission of the Singapore Red Cross Society, Red Cross in Xinmin Primary aims to build a community of young leaders who are socially responsible and embrace humanitarian values.&nbsp; Our Links members will be equipped with the necessary first aid knowledge such as dressing simple wounds and tying arm slings. Our Links were given the opportunity to demonstrate their proficiency in competitions such as the Red Cross National First Aid Competition.&nbsp; The CCA hopes to bring out the best of our Links and to prepare them for leadership in their families and communities as well as playing a part in helping to achieve national goal of having a first aider in every home.
