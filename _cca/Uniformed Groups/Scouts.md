# **Mission &amp; Key Programmes:**

Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youths with a strong emphasis on the duty to God and to the country and helping others.

Based on Kipling’s Jungle book, our Xinmin Scouts programme aims to provide an environment which develops the boys holistically.

Cub Scout activities here provide a dynamic platform for our youth to embark on a journey of personal growth and skill development. Rooted in the principles of the Scout Law, these activities encompass a diverse range of experiences, including camping, knot tying, nature exploration, and community service. Through engaging in these pursuits, Cub Scouts not only acquire practical outdoor skills but also cultivate teamwork through collaboration, leadership, and a strong sense of community. The programme emphasises character building, instilling values like honesty and respect. These well-rounded activities foster a spirit of adventure, curiosity, and lifelong friendships among the Cub Scout community.

During our CCA sessions, our Xinmin Scouts aim to earn a series of badges through games and activities. The badges are a form of recognition and encouragement of their interest and talents. The activities provide them knowledge of basic Scouting skills.
