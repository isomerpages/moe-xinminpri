# **Scouts**


### CCA Mission &amp; Key Programmes:

As one of the oldest youth movements in Singapore (celebrated our 100th Anniversary in year 2010), Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youths with a strong emphasis on the duty of God and to the country and helping others.

Based on Kiplingâ€™s Jungle book, our Xinmin Cub Scouts programme aims to provide an environment which develops the boys holistically.

During our CCA sessions, our Xinmin Cub Scouts aim to earn a series of badges through games and activities. These activities provide them knowledge of basic Scouting skills such as knotting and pitching of tents. At the same time, they learn the values of discipline, teamwork, leadership skills and an adventurous spirit to do things they have not attempted before.
