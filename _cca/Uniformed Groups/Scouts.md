# **Mission &amp; Key Programmes:**

Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youths with a strong emphasis on the duty of God and to the country and helping others.

Based on Kiplingâ€™s Jungle book, our Xinmin Scouts programme aims to provide an environment which develops the boys holistically.

During our CCA sessions, our Xinmin Scouts aim to earn a series of badges through games and activities. The badges are a form of recognition and encouragement of their interest and talents. The activities provide them knowledge of basic Scouting skills such as knotting and pitching of tents. At the same time, they learn the values of discipline, collaboration, leadership skills and an adventurous spirit to do things they have not attempted before.
