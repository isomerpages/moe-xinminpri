# **Mission & Key Programmes:**

### **Scouting at Xinmin: Empowering Holistic Development in Youths**

Our Scouting programme is dedicated to fostering the physical, mental, spiritual and social growth of our youth, emphasising the importance of duty to God, country and community.

### **Inspired by Kipling's Jungle Book**

Our programme draws inspiration from Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book", providing a nurturing environment that promotes holistic development in our Scouts.

### **Cub Scout Activities: Adventure, Skill-Building, and Character Development**

Through our Cub Scout activities, we offer a dynamic platform for our youth to embark on a journey of personal growth, skill development and adventure. Our programme is rooted in the principles of the Scout Law and encompasses a diverse range of experiences, including:

* 	Camping and outdoor exploration
* 	Knot tying and basic Scouting skills
* 	Nature exploration and environmental awareness
* 	Community service and social responsibility

### **Fostering Teamwork, Leadership, and Character**

Our activities are designed to cultivate teamwork, leadership and a strong sense of community among our Cub Scouts. We emphasise character building, instilling values such as honesty, respect and compassion. Through our programme, we aim to foster a spirit of adventure, curiosity and lifelong friendships among our Scouts.

### **Earning Badges and Recognising Achievements**


During our CCA sessions, our Xinmin Scouts work towards earning a series of badges through engaging games and activities. These badges serve as recognition and encouragement of their interests, talents and achievements, providing them with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
