# **C.L.O.V.E (Cultivating a Life of Values and Excellence)**


### **Clove @ Xinmin Primary program is an integral part of the curriculum at all levels.**

This is done by:

i.	Creating Learning Opportunities in Formal Curriculum

ii.	Exposure for All in Sports & Co-Curricular Programs

iii.	Values Education through Fun & Memorable Activities

Students are given many opportunities to experience character traits, see them in action, and fell them rather than just talk about them. Community-based, real-world experiences that illustrate character traits are included in the curriculum. 

Values in Action, cooperative learning and peer mentoring are important parts of the approach. Ample time is also allowed for the discussion and reflection.
