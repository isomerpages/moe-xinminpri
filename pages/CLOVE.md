# **G.L.O.B.E (Cultivating a Life of Values and Excellence)**

# **Vision:**
Nurturing Every Xinminite to Be an Environmental Steward for Life

# **Mission:**
To broaden and deepen Xinminitesâ€™ environmental knowledge, and inculcate a sense of responsibility in making positive environmental efforts


Clove @ Xinmin Primary program is an integral part of the curriculum at all levels.
This is done by:
i.	Creating Learning Opportunities in Formal Curriculum
ii.	Exposure for All in Sports & Co-Curricular Programs
iii.	Values Education through Fun & Memorable Activities
Students are given many opportunities to experience character traits, see them in action, and fell them rather than just talk about them. Community-based, real-world experiences that illustrate character traits are included in the curriculum. Values in Action, cooperative learning and peer mentoring are important parts of the approach. Ample time is also allowed for the discussion and reflection.
