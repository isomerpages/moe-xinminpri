# **Homework Policy**

### HOMEWORK POLICY (For PARENTS’ INFORMATION)

**1\. Purpose of Homework**

Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual/ online). This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

**2\. Objectives of Homework**

Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students’ learning, provide feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards continual learning. Effective use of homework can:

* Reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught.
* Allow students to regularly practise, apply skills and concepts taught.
* Develop good study skills and habits.
* Encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.
* Provide parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and opportunities to be involved in their child’s learning.


**3\. Quantity of Homework**

The school is mindful of the well-being of students when assigning homework. For holistic development, students need to have a balanced life with adequate time for family bonding, social activities, personal interests and rest.

**4\. We use the following guidelines when assigning homework:**



| Level | Approximate Daily Homework Load (Mon – Fri)| Maximum Weekly Homework Load (Mon – Fri) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| P1 &amp; P2    | 45mins     | 4hr     |
| P3 &amp; P4    | 1hr     | 6hr     |
| P1 &amp; P2    | 2hr     | 11hr     |



**4\. What students should do**
