# **Homework Policy**

### HOMEWORK POLICY (For PARENTS’ INFORMATION)

**1\. Definition of Homework**

Homework refers to any learning activity in curricular subjects that schools require students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual/ online).

**2\. Objectives of Homework**

Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students' learning, provide feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards continual learning. Effective use of homework can:

* Reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught.
* Allow students to practise, apply skills and concepts taught regularly.
* Develop good study skills and habits.
* Encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.
* Provide parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and opportunities to be involved in their child's learning.


**3\. Quantity of Homework**

The school is mindful of the well-being of students when assigning homework. For holistic development, students need to have a balanced life with adequate time for family bonding social activities, personal interests and rest. The following
guidelines apply when assigning homework:
