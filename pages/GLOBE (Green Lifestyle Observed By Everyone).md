# **G.L.O.B.E (Green Lifestyle Observed By Everyone)**

# **Vision:**
Nurturing Every Xinminite to Be an Environmental Steward for Life

# **Mission:**
To broaden and deepen Xinminites’ environmental knowledge, and inculcate a sense of responsibility in making positive environmental efforts

## **Signature Programmes**

Programmes for G.L.O.B.E., the Environmental Science Education Applied Learning Programme in XMPS, have been carefully curated and executed to equip students to be Lifelong Learners and do their parts to alleviate environmental problems.

### (1) Hydroponics Farming

Innovative and sustainable farming methods such as hydroponics pique students' curiosity about plant reproduction and environmental science as they learn to grow their own food using non-traditional soilless methods. Through hands-on experience in planting, transplanting and crop harvesting, students are inspired to share their food and learning with their families.


### (2) GrowFridge Farming

Students experience growing herbs and vegetables using new innovations. The micro-fridge device is Singapore's first plug-and-play smart micro-farm, designed like a kitchen appliance that allows students and teachers to grow their own microgreens under controlled climatic conditions in the comfort of an indoor setting. Students not only gain deep knowledge of healthy living but also learn about urban farming technology, such as temperature settings, watering cycles and lighting for optimal plant growth.

### (3) Aeroponics Vertical Farming

Students learn the techniques of using aeroponics, a plant cultivation technique in which roots hang suspended in the air while nutrient solution is delivered to them in an air or mist environment. The nutrient-rich solution is sprayed or dripped directly onto the plant roots, eliminating the need for soil. Students use this aeroponic urban farming system that allows plants to be grown vertically, so farming and food production take up much less space than traditional farming. It is also more efficient and environmentally sustainable.

### (4) Veggie Pod Farming

By growing vegetables in raised and covered garden beds, students learn that farming can be carried out efficiently in a controlled environment, away from common garden pests. The installation of a self-watering system allows for even greater efficiency in this method of farming. Through fun, hands-on experiences of planting, transplanting and crop harvesting, students are inspired to share both their harvest and urban farming experiences with their families!

### (5) Veggie Pod Farming

Students take charge of their learning and develop responsibility in caring for the vegetables. As the Veggie Tower replicates a natural ecosystem and converts kitchen scraps into natural fertiliser for the vegetables, this programme inspires students to learn more about the processes of decomposition and plant growth.

### (6) Aquaponics Farming

Students learn the techniques of aquaponics farming, a unique method that combines aquaculture (the practice of raising fish) with hydroponics (the method of growing plants in a soilless environment).

In this system, students witness fish and plants being cultivated together in a symbiotic environment where they mutually benefit from each other's presence. The fish produce waste, which is converted by beneficial bacteria into nutrients that plants can absorb. In turn, the plants filter and purify the water, creating a healthy environment for the fish.

### (7) Aquaponics Farming

The rice planting programme aims to inculcate good sustainability habits and knowledge in Xinminites. Under the guidance of a rice farmer and a scientist, students experience first-hand the entire rice planting process, from seed germination and seedling transplanting to rice harvesting. Through this programme, students understand that rice planting is an arduous process involving back-breaking effort and thus learn to appreciate the rice on their plates, becoming confident leaders and advocates of food waste reduction. Through their rice planting efforts, students learn endurance and build resilience in overcoming challenging conditions.

Organised by the Singapore Environment Council, the annual School Green Awards recognise efforts by schools that have achieved positive environmental impacts. Having achieved top scores for three consecutive years, Xinmin Primary School was first conferred the highest tiered award – the Sustained Achievement Award – in 2022. For our continuous efforts in inculcating a green lifestyle in Xinminites, the school was presented with this prestigious award again in 2023 and 2024.
