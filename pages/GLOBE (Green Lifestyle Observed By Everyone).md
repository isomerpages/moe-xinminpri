# **G.L.O.B.E (Green Lifestyle Observed By Everyone)**

# **Vision:**
Nurturing Every Xinminite to Be an Environmental Steward for Life

# **Mission:**
To broaden and deepen Xinminites’ environmental knowledge, and inculcate a sense of responsibility in making positive environmental efforts

## **Signature Programmes**

Programmes for G.L.O.B.E., the Environmental Science Education Applied Learning Programme in XMPS, have been carefully curated and executed to equip students to be Lifelong Learners and do their parts to alleviate environmental problems.

### **(1) Hydroponics Farming**

Innovative and sustainable farming methods such as Hydroponics pique students’ curiosity about the process of reproduction in plants and environmental science as they learn about how they can grow their own food using non-traditional soil-less methods. With the hands-on experience of planting, transplanting and crop harvesting, students are inspired to share their food and learning with their families. 

### **(2) GrowFridge Farming**

Students experience growing herbs and vegetables using new innovations. The micro-fridge device is Singapore’s first plug-and-play smart micro-farm designed like a kitchen appliance to allow students and teachers to grow their own micro-greens, under controlled climatic conditions, in the comforts of an indoor setting. Students not only gain deep knowledge in healthy living but also learn urban farming technology such as temperature setting, watering cycle and lighting for optimal plant growth.

### **(3) Organic Veggie Tower Farming**

Students take charge of their learning and develop responsibility in caring for the vegetables. As the Veggie Tower replicates a natural ecosystem and turns kitchen scraps into natural fertilisers for the vegetables, this programme inspires students to find out more about the processes of decomposition and plant growth.

### **(4) Rice Planting & Food Sustainability Programme**

The rice planting programme aims to inculcate good sustainability habits and knowledge in Xinminites. Under the guidance of a rice farmer and a scientist, students experience first-hand the entire rice-planting process from seed germination, seedling transplanting to rice-harvesting. Through this programme, students will understand that rice-planting is an arduous process that involves back-breaking efforts and, thus, appreciate the rice grains on their plates and become Confident Leaders and advocates of food waste reduction. Through their rice-planting efforts, students learn endurance and build resilience in overcoming challenging conditions.

## **Awards**

### **(1) School Green Awards - Vanda Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award 2023**
