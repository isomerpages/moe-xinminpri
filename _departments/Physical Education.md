# **Vision:**

Every Xinminite, a **physically educated** child.

# **Mission:**

Nurturing the **Passion** for **Sports**.

### PE Curriculum aims to develop Xinminites to be:

* Self-directed learners who participate actively in all PE activities, enabling them to lead a physically active lifestyle both in school and beyond.

* Active participants who work collaboratively through various team activities during PE lessons, engaging in teaching pedagogies such as Sports Education and participating in inter-class competitions.

* Confident leaders in PE lessons and sports activities through roles as PE Monitors, Sports Leaders and PE Group Leaders. These students receive centralised and de-centralised training to assist PE teachers during and after lessons, lead their classes in warm-up and cool-down exercises, and captain their PE groups in intra- and inter-class games.

Through PE lessons and sports-related programmes, our mission is to nurture a passion for sports in every child. Students not only learn essential physical skills but also have opportunities to develop into innovative collaborators through activities such as devising strategies for team sports.


# **Key Programmes**

### Sports Carnival

The Sports Carnival is a major event for both students and the PE Department. During this carnival, students showcase the skills they have acquired in PE lessons and celebrate their newfound knowledge. It also serves as a platform where classes, led by their confident PE leaders, display their class spirit and perform to the best of their abilities.

### **Unstructured Recess Play**

Unstructured recess play serves as an informal platform that enhances both physical activity and social development. During this time, students take charge of organising their own games and activities, developing leadership abilities and collaborative skills. These student-initiated interactions create meaningful opportunities for teamwork, problem-solving, and navigating social situations in an authentic setting. 

When given choices in their play activities, students build physical fitness while strengthening their social confidence and peer relationships. The informal yet enriching environment encourages students to develop essential skills in physical activity, social interaction, and self-directed learning that extend well beyond the classroom.
