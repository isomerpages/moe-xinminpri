# VISION

# MISSION 
Every Tamil student in Xinmin Primary to have a strong foundation in Tamil language and culture.

# Key Programmes:

  Xinmin’s Tamil Language (TL) curriculum places a strong emphasis on oral and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites to be effective communicators. We create opportunities for students to express themselves effectively through various programmes organized which will instill in students the strong desire to learn and understand the Tamil Language and be appreciative of the culture. The following key prorammes have been implemented to help us realise our department vision and mission.

### Speech and drama

Authentic and meaningful activities such as the Speech and Drama programme planned for our Primary 1 & 2 students allows them to express their thoughts freely and confidently in their MTL from a young age.

### Creative writing

Through our creative writing workshop, the students                       learn to express themselves effectively in written form and also learn skills like poster making foradvertisements, poem and song writing. This promotes our students’ curiosity as they get to  explore and select the appropriate modes of expressions.

### Tamil newspaper subscription

      To enable our student  to be exposed to current affairs and  empathise to those less fortunate than them, Tamil newspaper has been introduced to all students studying Tamil language. With these rich resources, students will be given opportunities to discuss about the articles read in the newspaper, present their results to the class and be open to receive others’ views.

### Home reading programme

       Our Primary 1 and 2 students will bring home a Tamil

       storybook fortnightly to read and discuss with their parents.

       Through this programme, we hope to foster parent-school

        partnership and encourage parents to inculcate the

        reading habit by spending time to read together with their

        child.

### Reading Programme

        Students from P3 to P6 are encouraged to read Tamil

        storybooks through organised activities like visit to the school library and reading time within the class library. Reading cards are given to all students which allow them to show their understanding of stories and further excite them with fun filled activities to motivate them to continue reading.

Reading badges are also awarded to students who fulfill criteria. Through this programme, we hope to develop passionate learners of the language who are confident in expressing themselves.

To expose our students to their own culture and values, our cultural programmes aim to provide an immersive environment for our students to learn and use the language as well as to appreciate the culture.

       indoor and outdoor traditional games.There are also ample

       opportunities for the students to collaborate with their
