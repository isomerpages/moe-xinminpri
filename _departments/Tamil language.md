# VISION 
Be an effective communicator who is a self-directed learner and one who appreciates Tamil language and culture.

# MISSION 
Every Tamil student in Xinmin Primary to have a strong foundation in Tamil language and culture.

# Key Programmes:

Xinmin’s Tamil Language (TL) curriculum places a strong emphasis on oral and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites to be effective communicators. We create opportunities for students to express themselves effectively through various programmes to instill in students a strong desire to learn and understand the Tamil Language and to be appreciative of the culture. The following key prorammes have been implemented to help us realise our department vision and mission.

### Speech and Drama

Authentic and meaningful activities such as the Speech and Drama programme planned for our Primary 1 & 2 students allows them to express their thoughts freely and confidently in their MTL from a young age.

### Language Booster Games

Through Language Booster Games workshop, we hope to instil in students the spirit of life-long learning as well as pique their curiosity in learning new words and phrases in Tamil. Through this workshop, students will think and speak in Tamil confidently and develop their communication skills by expressing their ideas clearly and effectively.

### Media Communication

Through our media communication workshop, students are given the opportunity to express themselves effectively in spoken Tamil through re-enactment and role-playing using scripts provided. The workshop develops our students’ communication skills as well as their ability to collaborate with their peers. 

### Tamil Newspaper Subscription

To enable our student to be exposed to current affairs and empathise to those less fortunate than them, Tamil newspaper has been introduced to all students studying Tamil language. With these rich resources, students will be given opportunities to discuss about the articles read in the newspaper, present their results to the class and be open to receive others’ views.

### Home reading programme

       Our Primary 1 and 2 students will bring home a Tamil

       storybook fortnightly to read and discuss with their parents.

       Through this programme, we hope to foster parent-school

        partnership and encourage parents to inculcate the

        reading habit by spending time to read together with their

        child.

### Reading Programme

        Students from P3 to P6 are encouraged to read Tamil

        storybooks through organised activities like visit to the school library and reading time within the class library. Reading cards are given to all students which allow them to show their understanding of stories and further excite them with fun filled activities to motivate them to continue reading.

Reading badges are also awarded to students who fulfill criteria. Through this programme, we hope to develop passionate learners of the language who are confident in expressing themselves.

To expose our students to their own culture and values, our cultural programmes aim to provide an immersive environment for our students to learn and use the language as well as to appreciate the culture.

       activities such as Kolam, pot painting and different types of

       indoor and outdoor traditional games.There are also ample

       opportunities for the students to collaborate with their
