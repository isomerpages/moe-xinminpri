Xinmin's Tamil Language (TL) curriculum emphasises oral and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites into effective communicators. Through various programmes, we create opportunities for students to express themselves confidently while cultivating their appreciation for Tamil language and culture. The following key programmes support our department's vision and mission:

#### Speech and Drama

Authentic and meaningful activities such as the Speech and Drama programme planned for our Primary 1 & 2 students allow them to express their thoughts freely and confidently in their MTL from a young age. 

#### Language Booster Games

The Language Booster Games Workshop aims to develop students' curiosity in learning new Tamil words and phrases while nurturing their spirit of lifelong learning. During these sessions, students develop confidence in Tamil thinking and speaking, enhancing their communication skills through clear and effective expression of ideas.

#### Media Communication

The Media Communication Workshop provides students opportunities to enhance their spoken Tamil through script-based role-playing and re-enactment activities. This interactive approach develops students' communication skills while strengthening their collaborative abilities with peers.

#### Tamil Newspaper Subscription

Tamil newspapers have been introduced to all Tamil Language students to increase their awareness of current affairs and develop empathy towards the less fortunate. Students engage with these rich resources through class discussions about newspaper articles and presentations, learning to share their perspectives while remaining receptive to different viewpoints.

Primary 1 and 2 students bring home Tamil storybooks fortnightly to read and discuss with their parents. This programme strengthens the parent-school partnership while encouraging families to develop reading habits through shared reading time.
