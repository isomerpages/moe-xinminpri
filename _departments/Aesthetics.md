Through Art & Music lessons and programmes, our mission is to nurture a passion for the Arts in every child. Besides learning specific skills, the activities provide students with opportunities to become innovative collaborators (e.g. creating melodies or designing art pieces in groups).

### **Aesthetics Signature Programmes**

### P4 Museum-based Cohort Learning Journey

As part of the P4 Art curriculum, students embark on an enriching learning journey to National Gallery Singapore. This experience aims to deepen their understanding of the museum as a custodian of Singapore's culture and heritage, explore Singapore Art as part of the MOE Art syllabus, and engage in Museum-Based Learning activities to foster observation and inquiry into local artworks. Students uncover how connections were forged in Singapore's history while reflecting on connections in their own lives.

### Xinmin Got Talent

Xinmin Got Talent takes place biennially. It is a platform for our Xinminites to showcase their talents. We encourage students to exhibit their talents either individually or in collaboration with friends. Through this platform, performers build resilience and confidence. The audience is exposed to different forms of performing arts and learns to appreciate and support their peer performers.

### Arts Alive@Recess

Through Arts Alive@Recess, we provide opportunities to ignite Xinminites' passion for the visual arts in a nurturing environment. Art activities are specially planned by Art teachers and conducted by parent volunteers during recess. Besides eating, students are encouraged to spend their time meaningfully with activities like origami craft work, pebble painting and designing bookmarks.

### Performing HeArts Concert

Performing HeArts takes place biennially at Xinmin Primary School and is highly anticipated by both performers and parents. The concert showcases diverse artistic talents from the Performing Arts CCAs â€“ Modern Dance, Chinese Dance, Guzheng Ensemble and Choir.

The Singapore Youth Festival is an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the vitality of our youths and their diverse talents. Our Aesthetics CCAs - Art & Crafts CCA, Modern Dance, Chinese Dance, Guzheng Ensemble and Choir participate actively in SYF. It provides an excellent platform to showcase our Xinminites' development and diverse artistic talents through collaboration among peers within the CCAs.
