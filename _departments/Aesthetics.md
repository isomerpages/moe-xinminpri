## **Aesthetics Signature Programmes**

### **Aesthetics Week**

Our annual Aesthetics Week is a celebration of the arts (visual and music) with the aim of igniting the passion for arts in our Xinminites. The students are given the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities in class and during recess. It is not just about creating things but about appreciating the beauty of Aesthetics in our lives. 

### **Arts Alive@Recess**

The environment is the third teacher, thus we provide opportunities to nurture the passion for the visual arts through Arts Alive@ recess. Art activities were specially planned by the art teachers and conducted by parent volunteers during recess. Besides consuming food during recess, students are encouraged to meaningfully occupy their time with art activities like origami craft work, pebble painting, designing bookmarks.

### **Xinmin Got Talent**

Xinmin Got Talent is a platform for our Xinminites to showcase their talents. We encourage our students to exhibit any form of talents either individually or collaborate with their friends to put up a performance. Through this platform, the performers build their resilience and confidence. The audience are exposed to different forms of performing arts and learn to appreciate and show support to their peer performers.

### **Performing HeArts Concert**

Performing HeArts takes place biannually at Xinmin Primary School and is highly anticipated by both performers and parents. The concert showcases the diversity of artistic talents from the Performing Arts CCAs – Modern Dance, Chinese Dance, Guzheng Ensemble and Choir.
