# **English Language**

**Vision**    
Every Xinminite, an active reader, a confident speaker and a competent writer with a love for the English Language.

**Mission**    
We strive to build a strong foundation in English for every Xinminite and provide a rich language environment for developing the language.

### Key Programmes    
To develop **active readers**, Xinminites are given access and exposure to a variety of books and reading materials.

*   Class Book Flood

Every class is provided with a set of books of different titles and genres for students to choose from. These books can be borrowed during the reading periods or taken home to allow our Xinminites to explore what they like and eventually to read more and discover the joy of reading.

*   Home Reading Programme

Every fortnight, Primary 1 and Primary 2 Xinmintes take a storybook home to read and discuss with their parents. Parents are encouraged to spend time reading together with their child and inculcate the reading habit.

*   _Little Red Dot_ Newspaper Subscription

All students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 subscribe to the _Little Red Dot_ Newspaper. The exposure to current affairs helps create awareness of local and global issues and broaden the minds of our Xinminites. They also translate what they read in the LRD newspapers into the written reflection and oral presentations in class.

*   _myON_

An online digital library, _myON_ provides a personalised reading experience. Xinminites can select books to read anytime and anywhere based on their reading level and interests. The _myON_ platform also allows teachers and parents to monitor their reading progress and understanding.

To develop **confident speakers**, the _Six Traits of Speaking_ is taught during Speak Up! lessons from Primary 1 to Primary 6. Adapted from a book by Eric Palmer, students learn how to speak confidently in front of an audience using the six traits.

*   Speak Up! _Six Traits of Speaking_
    1.  Posture
    2.  Voice
    3.  Life
    4.  Eye contact
    5.  Gestues
    6.  Speed

To develop **competent writers**, a progressive and differentiated approach to writing is conducted in line with English Language STELLAR programme for primary schools.

*   Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)

In the lower primary English lessons, Xinminites learn how to write independently by integrating the knowledge gained through reading the STELLAR big book and related learning experiences. They are taken through a guided writing process (class and group writing) before embarking on individual writing.

*   Mentor Texts

As Xinminites progress to upper primary, they are exposed to mentor texts in addition to the STELLAR texts to help them hone their writing skills. Through mentor texts, Xinminites examine how vocabulary is used in context, learn different sentence patterns and discover writing techniques.
