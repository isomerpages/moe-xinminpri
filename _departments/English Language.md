# **Vision** 

Every Xinminite, an active reader, a confident speaker and a competent writer with a love for the English Language.

# **Mission** 

We strive to build a strong foundation in English for every Xinminite and provide a rich language environment for developing the language.

### STELLAR Curriculum:

The school adopts the STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning and Reading) programme in the teaching and learning of the English Language. Lessons are designed to immerse students in authentic and engaging language experiences to strengthen their language skills and command of the English language. Through differentiated instructions and explicit teaching of language skills, Xinminites are empowered to develop a positive attitude and be responsible towards their own learning. Other teaching strategies include:

#### •	Shared Book Approach (SBA)

The Shared Book Approach involves teachers reading the STELLAR texts aloud where effective reading strategies are modelled. Through interactive and rich discussions on themes, characters and plot, Xinminites learn to listen attentively, engage in meaningful discussions, widen their vocabulary and deepen their comprehension. Repeated readings and assessments for learning help reinforce key language skills, while nurturing collaborative learning, critical thinking and a lifelong love for literature. 

#### •	Modified Learning Experiential Approach (MLEA)

In the lower primary English lessons, Xinminites develop their writing skills by integrating the knowledge gained through reading the STELLAR big books and related learning experiences. Guided through a structured writing process - class, group and individual writing – Xinminites learn to brainstorm and work on becoming innovative collaborators before embarking on individual writing where they unleash their creativity and express their own unique ideas.

#### •	Close and Critical Reading

Close and critical reading is fundamental in developing strong analytical and comprehension skills. Through gradual release of responsibility, Xinminites are guided to read texts with a pencil and make their thinking visible by annotating using a set of common symbols. To engage themselves deeply in the text, they visualise, ask questions, make connections and infer while thinking about what they are reading. Paying attention to details and literary devices within a text, Xinminites cultivate a more purposeful and reflective approach to reading and sharpen their critical thinking skills.

### • Mentor Texts
As Xinminites progress to upper primary, they are exposed to mentor texts in addition to the STELLAR texts to help them hone their writing skills. Through mentor texts, Xinminites examine how vocabulary is used in context, learn different types of sentence patterns and discover various writing techniques.

# **Key Programmes**

To develop active readers, Xinminites are given access and exposure to a variety of books and reading materials that would also propel them to be life-long learners. Our reading programme includes the following:

#### • Class Book Flood

Every class is provided with a set of books of different titles and genres for Xinminitess to choose from. These books can be borrowed during the silent reading periods or taken home to allow our Xinminites to explore what they like and pique their curiosity on topics that interest them. Through the book flood, they will read more and discover the joy of reading.

#### • Home Reading Programme (HRP)

In collaboration with the Mother Tongue department, Primary 1 and 2 Xinminites bring home an English storybook every alternate week to read and discuss with their parents. This programme aims to foster a strong partnership with parents by encouraging shared reading experiences to build meaning connections and inculcate the reading habit.
