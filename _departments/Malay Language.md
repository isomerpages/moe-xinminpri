<h1><strong>Vision</strong></h1>
<p>Every Malay Language student, an effective communicator who is passionate
and appreciates the language and culture.</p>
<h1><strong>Mission</strong></h1>
<p>Every Malay Language student develops a strong foundation in the language
and culture</p>
<h1><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h1>
<p>At Xinmin Primary, our Malay department emphasises four key learning skills:
listening, speaking, writing and reading. We focus on authentic activities
that effectively engage our students. Through these activities, we aim
to develop students' interest in and appreciation of their culture and
values by:</p>
<h3>Speech and Drama</h3>
<p>Authentic and meaningful activities, such as the Speech and Drama programme
designed for our Primary 1 and 2 students, allow them to express themselves
freely and confidently in their Mother Tongue Language from a young age.</p>
<h3>Home Reading Programme for P1 and P2</h3>
<p>Our Primary 1 and 2 students bring home a Malay storybook every fortnight
to read and discuss with their parents. Through this programme, we strengthen
home-school partnerships and encourage parents to develop their children's
reading habits through shared reading time.</p>
<h3>Reading Programme for P3 â€“ P6</h3>
<p>Primary 3 to 6 students explore Malay storybooks from the class library
to discover the world around them. Activities are specially designed to
help students demonstrate their understanding of the stories read. Reading
certificates are awarded termly to students who meet the set criteria.
This programme develops passionate language learners who are confident
in expressing themselves.</p>
<h3>P3 MT Fortnight activities &amp; P5 Cultural Camp</h3>
<p>Our cultural programmes provide an immersive environment where students
connect with rich Malay heritage while developing their language skills.</p>
<p>Students participate in engaging learning journeys to Kampong Buangkok
and experience hands-on activities such as traditional kuih-making and
basket weaving. They also explore various indoor and outdoor traditional
games, collaborating with peers to create and play these games, deepening
their appreciation of Malay culture and traditions.</p>
<h3>Malay newspaper subscription for P4 - P6</h3>
<p>Newspaper supplements enhance classroom teaching and learning. Students
explore current affairs through articles, followed by grammar exercises
and listening comprehension activities. They discuss the articles and present
their views to their classmates, developing both language skills and confidence.</p>
<h3>School Based competitions</h3>
<p>Students are provided opportunities to showcase their talents through
various competitions, including poetry recitation, spelling bee, language
quizzes, essay writing and Scrabble.</p>
