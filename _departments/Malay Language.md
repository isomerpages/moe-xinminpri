# **Vision** 
Every Malay student, an effective communicator who is passionate about and appreciates Malay language and culture.

# **Mission** 
Every Malay student develops a strong foundation in the Malay language and culture

# **Key Programmes** 
At Xinmin Primary, our Malay department emphasises four key learning skills: listening, speaking, writing and reading. We focus on authentic activities that effectively engage our students. Through these activities, we aim to develop students' interest in and appreciation of their culture and values by:

### Speech and Drama
Authentic and meaningful activities, such as the Speech and Drama programme designed for our Primary 1 and 2 students, allow them to express themselves freely and confidently in their Mother Tongue Language from a young age.

### Home Reading Programme for P1 and P2
Our Primary 1 and 2 students bring home a Malay storybook every fortnight to read and discuss with their parents. Through this programme, we strengthen home-school partnerships and encourage parents to develop their children's reading habits through shared reading time.

### Reading Programme for P3 â€“ P6
Primary 3 to 6 students explore Malay storybooks from the class library to discover the world around them. Activities are specially designed to help students demonstrate their understanding of the stories read. Reading certificates are awarded termly to students who meet the set criteria. This programme develops passionate language learners who are confident in expressing themselves.

### P3 MT Fortnight activities & P5 Cultural Camp
Our cultural programmes provide an immersive environment where students connect with rich Malay heritage while developing their language skills. 

Students participate in engaging learning journeys to Kampong Buangkok and experience hands-on activities such as traditional kuih-making and basket weaving. They also explore various indoor and outdoor traditional games, collaborating with peers to create and play these games, deepening their appreciation of Malay culture and traditions.


### Malay newspaper subscription for P4 - P6
Newspaper supplements enhance classroom teaching and learning. Students explore current affairs through articles, followed by grammar exercises and listening comprehension activities. They discuss the articles and present their views to their classmates, developing both language skills and confidence.

### School Based competitions
Students are provided opportunities to showcase their talents through various competitions, including poetry recitation, spelling bee, language quizzes, essay writing and Scrabble.
