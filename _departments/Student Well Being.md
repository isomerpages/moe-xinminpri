# **Student Well-Being**

**Vision**

To engender a caring and enabling school environment for all Xinminites

**Mission**

*   To support the well-being of Xinminites through a caring and enabling school environment.
*   Nurture positive attitudes and equip students with necessary knowledge, skills to meet lifelong challenges.
*   Establish and develop an effective working relationship between school and community through partnerships.




**Key Programmes**

**Peer Support**

Peer support programmes are carried to develop every Xinminite as a peer supporter for one another.

The aims of the peer support programmes are

*   To empower students to look out and care for each others through bonding, helping and positive influence.
*   To promote positive mindsets, prosocial behaviours and mental well-being among students.

Each Xinminite will go through a structured peer support programme to build skills and competencies to show kindness and care and develop mindsets to be a positive influence for positive mindsets and pro-social online and offline behaviours. The programme is delievered through CCE lessons and student development exercises such as CCA, class activities as well as cohort camps.

Some Xinminites will be chosen as Peer Support Leaders as advocators of positive influence and to look out and connect with their classmates for well-being issues.&nbsp; These Leaders are selected by the teachers and trained by the school to effectively perform the role.

**Cyberwellness**

Cyberwellness is taught to equip every Xinminite with knowledge and skills to harness the power of technology for positive purposes and to be respectful and responsible uses while advocating for the good of community online.

**Key messages**

These are the key messages which students will understand:

1.  Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities
2.  Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence
3.  Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace

Cyberwellness lessons are taught during FTGP as well as CCE lessons.

**Special Needs Education (SEN)**

We follow a tiered system of support where we take a whole school approach to identify and support student needs by using data and make decisions about students based on good data as well as utilizing a problem-solving process. The school works in partnership with the Ministry of Education Psychological Services Branch in:

*   systematically identifying student needs
*   planning support that is matched to these student needs
*   providing the support through quality instruction at all tiers
