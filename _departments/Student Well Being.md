Student Well-Being 
Vision 
Every Xinminite a responsible cyber citizen, a caring peer and a resilient individual. 
Mission
We strive to develop in every Xinminite, good prosocial online and offline behaviour, dispositions to show care for the community and being adaptable to respond to challenges.
Key Programmes
To help realise our departments vision and mission, we have crafted the following programming for them.
Peer Support
Peer support programmes develop every Xinminite as a peer supporter for one another.The aims of the peer support programmes are:
To empower students to look out and care for each others through bonding, helping and being a positive influence.
To promote positive mindsets, prosocial behaviours and mental well-being among students.
Each Xinminite will go through a structured peer support programme to build competencies to develop mindsets to be a positive influence for others through pro-social online and offline behaviours. The programme is delivered through CCE lessons and student development activities such as CCA, and cohort camps.
Some Xinminites will be chosen as Peer Support Leaders as advocators of positive influence they will look out and connect with their classmates for well-being issues.  These Peer Support Leaders are selected by the teachers and trained by the school to effectively perform the role.
Cyberwellness
Cyberwellness lessons are progressively designed to equip every Xinminite with knowledge and skills to harness the power of technology for positive purposes while learning to be respectful and responsible users.
Through these lessons, our Xinminites will embody the following attributes: 
Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.
Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.
Be responsible for their personal well-being in the cyberspace.
Share and Care
This is a termly school-based programme which students are encouraged to appreciate Xinminite staff for sharing and showing care to them. The objective of the programme is to imbue in our students the value of showing appreciation to others and to cultivate gratitude for the care shown by our staff.
PACE@XMP
PACE@XMP is targeted to increase the self-esteem of Xinminites who face different challenges at home and school. The programme builds upon the Self Determination Theory of Motivation and promotes the development of:
A Learner who is open minded to take up challenges to learn new skills and improve himself/ herself and a collaborator who works well with others, adaptable to changing circumstances and resilient in overcoming challenges.
