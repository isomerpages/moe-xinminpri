# **Vision** 

Every Xinminite, a responsible cyber citizen, an inclusive peer and a resilient individual.

# **Mission** 

We aim to develop every Xinminite into a responsible individual who demonstrates positive online and offline behaviour, shows genuine care for the community, and responds adaptably to challenges.

# **Key Programmes**

To help realise our departmentâ€™s vision and mission, we have crafted the following programmes for our Xinminites:

### Peer Support

Our Peer Support programmes aim to develop every Xinminite into an effective peer supporter. The objectives of these programmes are to:

* Empower students to look out for and care for one another through bonding activities, mutual support, and positive influence

* Promote positive mindsets, prosocial behaviours, and healthy mental well-being among students

Each Xinminite participates in a structured peer support programme that builds competencies and develops mindsets for creating positive influence through prosocial behaviours, both online and offline. The programme is integrated into CCE lessons and student development activities, including CCAs and cohort camps.

Selected students serve as Peer Support Leaders, becoming advocates of positive influence within the school community. These leaders connect with and support classmates who may need assistance. Teachers identify potential Peer Support Leaders, who then receive specific training from the school to perform their roles effectively.


### Cyberwellness

Cyber Wellness lessons are progressively designed to equip every Xinminite with the knowledge and skills to harness technology for positive purposes while becoming respectful and responsible users.

Through these lessons, our Xinminites learn to:

* Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities
* Be safe and responsible users of technology and maintain a positive online presence
* Be responsible for their personal well-being in cyberspace


### Programmes After-school to build Confidence and boost self-Esteem (PACE)

PACE aims to develop students into:

* Learners who are open-minded and embrace challenges to acquire new skills
* Collaborators who work effectively with others
* Leaders who adapt readily to changing circumstances

Through Growth Mindset programmes, individual portfolios and school projects, students apply their learning to enhance their personal and social development.
