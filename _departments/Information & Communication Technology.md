# **Vision** 
A community of future-ready and responsible digital learners

# **Mission** 
To enable active learning experiences and meaningful connected learning through an ICT- enriched learning environment.

# **Key Programmes**

To realise our vision, the following programmes have been specially designed to bring active and meaningful learning experiences for our Xinminites.

### Primary 1 and 2 ICT Lessons

The lower primary students learn basic ICT skills during their EL-ICT lessons. These lessons are carried out every fortnight by our resident ICT Trainer. Students are taught basic ICT and Digital Literacy skills. These lessons provide opportunity for students to develop knowledge and skills that are useful in the real world.

### Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 Digital Literacy Lessons

The ICT Department teachers conduct lessons to equip students with essential skills in digital content creation, information curation from the Internet, and meaningful collaboration that enhances their knowledge and subject mastery. These skills form part of the CLIP (Confident Leaders, Life-long Learners, Innovative Collaborators Programme) curriculum across different levels, delivered through face-to-face sessions and self-paced SLS lesson packages.

Armed with these competencies, students develop independence in creating digital publications and virtual content, using these platforms to showcase their learning across various subjects.


### Use of e-Pedagogy for Active Learning

Through technology, students create digital artefacts that demonstrate their learning journey. At Xinmin, our innovative teachers design lessons following the Active Learning Processes framework, enabling students to create and collaborate using skills acquired during ICT and Digital Literacy lessons. The Student Learning Space (SLS) remains the primary platform for delivering content and instructions that complement classroom teaching. This e-Pedagogy approach nurtures our Xinminites to become inquisitive, open-minded and self-directed learners.
