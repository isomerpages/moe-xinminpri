**Student Management**

**Vision:** 

Every Xinminite, a self-disciplined and morally upright individual, ready to serve and lead the school and community.

**Mission:** 

Building Self-discipline in Every Student.

**Approach:** 

In Xinmin Primary School, every child is a STAR.

**S** – Exercise **S**elf-discipline

**T** – Demonstrate **T**houghtfulness for others

**A** – Display positive **A**ttitude

**R** – Take **R**esponsibility for his/her own action

Grounded by our school philosophy ‘Building Positive Relationship’, we use various platforms to create a whole school approach that encourages positive school ethos and climate in which there is a culture of care, respect, trust, strong teacher-student relationship and student-student relationship.

**Our Customised Programmes:**

*   Watch Your Step

– Students return to their classroom without the supervision of their teachers after recess and before the start of their CCAs and extra lessons.

*   GOTCHA

– Students who display unacceptable behaviours when their teacher is not with them will be issued Gotcha slip. Their form teacher will speak to the class and discuss ways to prevent such unacceptable behaviour from happening again. Classes that received less than 3 GOTCHA slips per term are rewarded with treats and items that promote class bonding.

*   Catch Me Good

– Students who show act of kindness such as helping those in need and demonstrating care to the people around them will be recognised with a signature on their Catch Me Good card by the school staff. Upon receiving 5 signatures, students can redeem for a stationery that they need at the redemption booth at the end of every month. Upon completion of the Catch Me Good card, they can exchange for a ticket to Character Cove.

*   A trip to Character Cove

– Students who have done well, behaved well and done the school proud will be given a ticket to Character Cove. They can play board games and games on console and tablet such as Xbox, PS4 and iPad. They can also use the art and craft material provided in the room or have a football match at the Futsal table with their schoolmates.

*   We Hear You Xinminites (WHYx)

– We believe that students’ voices are important as it increases students’ sense of belonging in school. Students can share their thoughts on topics of concern or interest to them. Suggestions taken up and/or rejected by the school will be shared with the students during pre-assembly.

**Student Leadership**

**Vision:** 

Every Student, A Confident Leader

**Mission:** 

Nurturing the Leadership Potential in Every Student

**Approach:** 

In Xinmin Primary School, we view all students as potential leaders. Through our Student Leadership Development Programme, we aim to develop our students as effective leaders. The Student Leadership Development Programme is designed to equip our student leaders with the 21st century competencies, thereby providing ample opportunities for them to be involved and developed as leaders.

We envision all students to be Confident Leaders. They are able to lead self and lead with others in word and deed which is in alignment to our school motto, grounded on values. They are able to make a positive difference in the school and community

Through our Student Leadership Programme, we nurture Xinminites to be good role models who are equipped with motivational and organisational skills to face the challenges of an uncertain and a volatile world.
