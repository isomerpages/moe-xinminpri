# Vision:

Every Xinminite, a self-disciplined and morally upright individual, ready to serve and lead others.

# Mission:

To develop confident leaders in every Xinminite who has the moral courage to distinguish right from wrong, acts on them and contributes actively in class, school and community.

## Key Programmes:

### ·       **Watch Your Step**

_Xinminites independently return to their classrooms after recess and before the start of co-curricular activities (CCAs) and cognitive programmes._

In the absence of adult supervision, Xinminites learn to manage their behaviour, foster self-reliance, develop responsible decision-making skills, and assume accountability for their actions. This contributes significantly to their personal development and growth.

### ·       **Creating Harmony and Encouragement for Excellent Results (CHEER)**

_Xinminites collaborate with one another in the classroom to create an environment conducive to teaching for the teacher and learning for students._

To foster a positive and effective learning environment, teachers affix stickers on the board outside the classroom. Classes achieving the specified sticker count per term will be rewarded with treats and items that encourage and strengthen class bonding. Xinminites develop a sense of responsibility for their actions and understand the consequences of their choices. This is crucial for nurturing independence, personal growth, and accountability.

### ·       **Catch Me Good (CMG)**

_School staff acknowledge and appreciate Xinminites who exhibit acts of kindness, such as helping those in need and showing care towards others, by presenting them with a signature on their Catch Me Good card._

Recognising benevolent actions among Xinminites nurtures the development of confident leaders who have self-assurance and believe in their capacity to inspire and lead others. Acknowledging their positive contributions reinforces their confidence and motivates them to continue making a positive impact on those around them.

### ·       **We Hear You xinminites (WHYx)**

_An avenue for Xinminites to actively participate in decision-making processes by sharing their firsthand experiences and unique perspectives._

WHYx promotes a student-centered learning environment, aiming to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among Xinminites. This approach empowers students, encouraging them to play an active role in their educational journey and fostering a sense of ownership over their learning.
