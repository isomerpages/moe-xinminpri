# **Key Programmes**

### Watch Your Step

* Xinminites independently return to their classrooms after recess.

* In the absence of adult supervision, Xinminites learn to manage their behaviour, foster self-reliance, develop responsible decision-making skills and assume accountability for their actions. This contributes significantly to their personal development and growth.

### Catch Me Good (CMG)

* School staff acknowledge and appreciate Xinminites who exhibit acts of kindness, such as helping those in need and showing care towards others, by presenting them with a signature on their Catch Me Good card.

* Recognising benevolent actions among Xinminites helps develop confident leaders who demonstrate self-assurance and believe in their capacity to inspire and lead others. Acknowledging their positive contributions strengthens their confidence and encourages them to continue making meaningful impacts on those around them.

### We Hear You Xinminites (WHYx)

* An avenue for Xinminites to actively participate in decision-making processes by sharing their firsthand experiences and unique perspectives.

* WHYx promotes a student-centered learning environment, aiming to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among Xinminites. This approach empowers students, encouraging them to play an active role in their educational journey and fostering a sense of ownership over their learning.
