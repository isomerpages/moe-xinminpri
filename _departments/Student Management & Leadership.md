# Vision:

Every Xinminite, a self-disciplined and morally upright individual, ready to serve and lead others.

# Mission:

To develop confident leaders in every Xinminite who has the moral courage to distinguish right from wrong, acts on them and contributes actively in class, school and community.

# Key Programmes:

 To develop our Xinminites to be a confident leader, the following programmes were specifically designed for them .

### ·       **Watch Your Step**

_Xinminites to make their way back to their respective classroom after recess and before the commencement of co-curricular activities (CCAs) and extra lessons independently._

Through this activity, in the absence of adult supervision, Xinminites learn to regulate their behaviour, become self-reliant, develop responsible decision-making skills, and take responsibility for their actions, contributing to their personal development and growth.

### ·       **GOTCHA**

     In order to promote class unity, classes that receive fewer than three GOTCHA slips per term are rewarded with treats and items that promote and enhance class bonding.Gotcha slips are issued to students who display unacceptable behaviour which will be promptly addressed by a teacher who witnesses the action via a Gotcha slip.

Xinminites develop a sense of responsibility for their actions and understand the consequences of their choices affecting the class dynamism as every member plays an important role contributing to class morale.

### ·       **Catch Me Good**

    Staff to acknowledge and recognise students who display acts of kindness, such as helping those in need and demonstrating care towards others, by awarding them a signature on their Catch Me Good card. With that in mind, school designs the Catch Me Good movement which enables the growth of confident leaders who possess self-assurance and believe in their abilities to inspire and guide others. The acknowledgment of their positive actions reinforces their confidence and encourages them to make a positive impact on those around them.

### ·       **We Hear You xinminites (WHYx)**

    WHYx promotes a student-centered learning environment to foster innovative thinking and problem-solving skills among Xinminites. This approach empowers students, making them active participants in their own learning journey and cultivating a sense of ownership over their education by enabling them to contribute to decision-making processes based on their firsthand experiences and unique perspectives when they propose solutions/suggestions that improve school learning experiences.

Student leadership training programs are designed to develop Xinminites' self-leadership, team leadership, and thought leadership skills by imparting head, hand, and heart knowledge. These programs empower Xinminites to lead themselves effectively, collaborate with and guide teams, and inspire others through innovative and forward-thinking approaches. By fostering confidence and promoting collaboration, such training cultivates Xinminites who are not only confident leaders but also innovative collaborators. These programmes include
