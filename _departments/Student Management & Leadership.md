# **Key Programmes**

### Watch Your Step

* Xinminites independently return to their classrooms after recess.

* In the absence of adult supervision, Xinminites learn to manage their behaviour, foster self-reliance, develop responsible decision-making skills and assume accountability for their actions. This contributes significantly to their personal development and growth.

### Catch Me Good (CMG)

* School staff acknowledge and appreciate Xinminites who exhibit acts of kindness, such as helping those in need and showing care towards others, by presenting them with a signature on their Catch Me Good card.

* Recognising benevolent actions among Xinminites helps develop confident leaders who demonstrate self-assurance and believe in their capacity to inspire and lead others. Acknowledging their positive contributions strengthens their confidence and encourages them to continue making meaningful impacts on those around them.

Hear You Xinminites (WHYx)

* An avenue for Xinminites to actively participate in decision-making processes by sharing their firsthand experiences and unique perspectives.

* WHYx promotes a student-centered learning environment, aiming to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among Xinminites. This approach empowers students, encouraging them to play an active role in their educational journey and fostering a sense of ownership over their learning.

### Leadership Training Programmes

* Progressive leadership training programmes have been designed to enhance Xinminites' capabilities in self-leadership, team leadership, and thought leadership. These programmes enable students to lead themselves effectively, guide teams collaboratively, and inspire others through innovative and forward-thinking approaches. Through building confidence and encouraging teamwork, these training sessions develop Xinminites into confident leaders and innovative collaborators.

* Programmes include: 
- Generic training: Inclusive training designed for a broad audience.
- Specialised training: Tailored programmes focusing on specific skills or areas of expertise.
- Class leaders training (Category 2): Training catered to Xinminites holding leadership positions, guiding and serving their respective classes.  
- Student leaders Training (Category 3 & 4): Training catered to Xinminites holding leadership positions responsible for leading and serving the entire school community.
