MTL curriculum:

*   Greater emphasis on spoken & written interaction skills;
*   Greater focus on authentic activities to better engage students and develop their communication skills; and
*   Continue to expose students to their own culture & values through MTL learning

Tips for Parents to support the child in learning MTL:

*   Parents are encouraged to speak to your child in MTL as often as possible and show interest in your child’s MTL learning.
*   Parents can also engage in regular conversation with your child about his/her MTL experience in class.
*   Parents can also use a variety of resources to extend your child’s language and literacy skills in MTL such as MT story books or online portal.
*   Parents should encourage and accompany your child to revise MTL at home and to read more MTL reading materials.
*   Provide a conducive environment for learning MTL-e.g. set up a reading corner at home, watch suitable TV programmes in MTL.
