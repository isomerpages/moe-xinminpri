<h1><strong>Vision</strong></h1>
<p>Every Chinese Language student, an active learner with the <strong>passion</strong> for
the language and culture.</p>
<h1><strong>Mission</strong></h1>
<p>Developing <strong>effective communicators</strong> who <strong>appreciate</strong> the
Chinese language and <strong>culture</strong>.</p>
<h1><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h1>
<p>Xinminâ€™s Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum places a strong emphasis
on verbal and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites into
effective communicators of the Chinese Language. We believe in bringing
the language to life for our students to ignite their passion for it.</p>
<h3>Speech and Drama Programme</h3>
<p>Authentic and meaningful activities, such as the Speech and Drama programme
designed for our Primary 1 and 2 students, allow them to express themselves
freely and confidently in their Mother Tongue Language from a young age.</p>
<h3>Department Reading Programmes</h3>
<h4>Home Reading Programme</h4>
<p>Our Primary 1 and 2 students bring home a Chinese storybook every fortnight
to read and discuss with their parents. This programme strengthens the
partnership between home and school while encouraging parents to develop
their child's reading habits through shared reading time.</p>
<h4>Class Reading Programme</h4>
<p>Our Primary 1 to 4 students regularly explore Chinese storybooks during
lessons to promote extensive reading. Through carefully designed activities
and meaningful discussions, students develop critical thinking skills and
learn to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas.</p>
<h4>School Library Visits</h4>
<p>During school terms, students are scheduled to visit the school library
for silent reading sessions. This structured time helps them develop responsible
reading habits in a conducive environment. The library visits, complemented
by reading programmes, nurture passionate language learners who are confident
in expressing themselves.</p>
<h3>P1 to P3 Thumbs Up Junior Level Sharing</h3>
<p>A key programme involves regular sharing sessions where lower primary
students explore Thumbs Up magazine materials through online platforms
such as Zoom. These sessions enable students to discover interesting texts,
themes and current affairs beyond their textbooks. During these sessions,
students engage in meaningful discussions with their peers about the shared
content, sparking their curiosity as they acquire new knowledge and gain
a better understanding of the world around them. Combined with planned
reading programmes, these activities develop passionate learners who read
widely in their Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<p>To expose our students to their own culture and values, our cultural programmes
aim to provide an immersive environment for our students to learn and use
the language as well as to experience the culture.</p>
<h3>P3/P5 Cultural Camps, P4 Cultural Exposure Performance</h3>
<p>Our cultural programmes create an immersive environment for students to
experience Chinese traditions while developing their language skills. Through
Cultural Camps and Exposure Performances, students engage in interactive
hands-on activities such as Chinese calligraphy, kite painting and traditional
arts. Working collaboratively with their peers, students deepen their understanding
and appreciation of Chinese culture while practising the language in authentic
settings.their peers to learn and appreciate Chinese culture together.</p>
