# VISION:
Every Chinese student, an active learner with the passion for Chinese language and culture.

# MISSION:
Nurturing effective communicators who appreciates the Chinese language and culture.

# Key Programmes:
Xinmin’s Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum places a strong emphasis on verbal and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites into effective communicators of the Chinese Language. We believe in bringing the language to life for our students to ignite their passion for it.

### •	Speech and Drama Programme
Authentic and meaningful activities such as the Speech and Drama programme planned for our Primary 1 & 2 students allows them to express themselves freely and confidently in their MTL from a young age. 

### •	Department Reading Programmes

#### Home Reading Programme
Our Primary 1 and 2 students will bring home a Chinese storybook fortnightly to read and discuss with their parents. Through this programme, we hope to foster parent-school partnership and encourage parents to inculcate the reading habit by spending time to read together with their child.

#### Class Reading Programme
To encourage our students to read widely, our Primary 1 to 4 students are regularly exposed to Chinese storybooks during lessons. The activities designed for the students also allow for insightful reflections and through meaningful conversations, our students will be more open-minded to different opinions and thoughts..

#### School Library Visits
Our Primary 1 to 6 students are scheduled during the school terms to visit the school library for silent reading. This encourages our students to take responsibility of their reading habits in a conducive reading environment. By complimenting the library visits with reading programmes, we hope to develop passionate learners of the language confident in expressing themselves.


### •	P1 to P3 Thumbs Up Junior Level Sharing
Our key programme involves periodic level sharing sessions of lower primary Thumbs Up magazine materials through online platforms such as Zoom. This allows our students to explore beyond their textbooks on interesting texts, themes, and current affairs. Subsequently, students will immerse in meaningful conversations and discussions with their peers on the shared content. This encourages them to be curious as they acquire new knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world around them. Together with the reading programmes planned for them, we hope to develop passionate learners who reads widely in their MTL.

To expose our students to their own culture and values, our cultural programmes aim to provide an immersive environment for our students to learn and use the language as well as to experience the culture.

### •	P3/P5 Cultural Camps, P4 Cultural Exposure Performance
These programmes involve fun and interactive hands-on activities such as Chinese Calligraphy, Kite painting and other forms of traditional art. There are also ample opportunities for the students to collaborate with their peers to learn and appreciate Chinese culture together.
