# **Vision** 
Every Chinese student, an active learner with the **passion** for Chinese language and culture.

# **Mission** 
Developing **effective communicators** who **appreciate** the Chinese language and **culture**.

# **Key Programmes** 
Xinminâ€™s Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum places a strong emphasis on verbal and written interaction skills to develop our Xinminites into effective communicators of the Chinese Language. We believe in bringing the language to life for our students to ignite their passion for it.

###  Speech and Drama Programme
Authentic and meaningful activities, such as the Speech and Drama programme designed for our Primary 1 and 2 students, allow them to express themselves freely and confidently in their Mother Tongue Language from a young age.

### Department Reading Programmes

#### Home Reading Programme
Our Primary 1 and 2 students bring home a Chinese storybook every fortnight to read and discuss with their parents. This programme strengthens the partnership between home and school while encouraging parents to develop their child's reading habits through shared reading time.

#### Class Reading Programme
Our Primary 1 to 4 students regularly explore Chinese storybooks during lessons to promote extensive reading. Through carefully designed activities and meaningful discussions, students develop critical thinking skills and learn to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas.

#### School Library Visits
During school terms, students are scheduled to visit the school library for silent reading sessions. This structured time helps them develop responsible reading habits in a conducive environment. The library visits, complemented by reading programmes, nurture passionate language learners who are confident in expressing themselves.


### P1 to P3 Thumbs Up Junior Level Sharing
A key programme involves regular sharing sessions where lower primary students explore Thumbs Up magazine materials through online platforms such as Zoom. These sessions enable students to discover interesting texts, themes and current affairs beyond their textbooks. During these sessions, students engage in meaningful discussions with their peers about the shared content, sparking their curiosity as they acquire new knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world around them. Combined with planned reading programmes, these activities develop passionate learners who read widely in their Mother Tongue Language.

To expose our students to their own culture and values, our cultural programmes aim to provide an immersive environment for our students to learn and use the language as well as to experience the culture.

### P3/P5 Cultural Camps, P4 Cultural Exposure Performance
Our cultural programmes create an immersive environment for students to experience Chinese traditions while developing their language skills. Through Cultural Camps and Exposure Performances, students engage in interactive hands-on activities such as Chinese calligraphy, kite painting and traditional arts. Working collaboratively with their peers, students deepen their understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture while practising the language in authentic settings.their peers to learn and appreciate Chinese culture together.
