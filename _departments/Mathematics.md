# **Vision** 
Every Xinminite, a confident problem solver. 

# **Mission** 
Building confidence and fostering interest in mathematics.

# **Key Programmes**

At Xinmin Primary School, the Mathematics Department is committed to nurturing confident problem solvers. Guided by this vision: we design a variety of engaging activities throughout the year to provide rich learning experiences both in and beyond the classroom. These initiatives aim to build students' confidence and ignite their passion for mathematics.

### Mathematics Around Us

Students engage in authentic learning experiences where they take ownership of their learning, lead discussions, and participate actively, developing into self-directed, curious, and open-minded learners. These experiences reveal the joy of mathematical discovery, leading to enlightening 'Eureka' moments. By connecting mathematics to real-world applications in their daily lives, students develop deeper understanding, making their learning journey meaningful and engaging.

### Think Like a Mathematician 

Our in-house learning package, crafted by our Mathematics teachers, presents students with non-routine and open-ended problems. Through class discussions, students articulate their thought processes and reflect on their problem-solving strategies. This collaborative approach strengthens their ability to work in teams, adapt to challenges, and develop resilience when solving complex problems creatively.

### Spatial Visualisation Programme (SVP)

The SVP enhances students' metacognitive awareness by connecting abstract mathematical concepts to concrete objects. Through hands-on activities and guided exploration, students develop stronger spatial reasoning skills and visual understanding of mathematical concepts. This approach helps students comprehend mathematical ideas more effectively, understand their interconnections, and recognise their practical applications in the real world.

# **Specialty Programmes**

### **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**

LSM offers early intervention to support Primary 1 to Primary 4 students who require additional support in Mathematics. This programme helps students develop fundamental numeracy skills, enhancing their confidence in problem-solving.


### E2K Math Programme

The E2K Mathematics Programme enhances studentsâ€™ mathematical reasoning and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry-based approach. It provides opportunities for students to collaborate with peers, engage in mathematical thinking, and explore concepts through puzzles, games, and hands-on investigations. Through these rich learning experiences, students develop the mindset, habits, and dispositions of mathematicians, while also acquiring essential 21st-century competencies such as critical thinking, inventive problem-solving, and effective communication.

This enrichment programme is conducted by our teachers, who are trained in the E2K pedagogy, and is designed for selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students who demonstrate a strong interest and aptitude in Mathematics.
