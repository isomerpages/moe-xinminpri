##  LEARNING APPROACH

At Xinmin Primary School, the Math Department believes every child can be a confident problem solver.  With this vision in mind, various activities are planned throughout the year to ensure that there are rich learning experiences in and beyond the classroom for our students. 

Through these experiences, we hope to encourage our students to:

1. think and learn like a Mathematician
2. lead in Math discoveries 
3. collaborate in solving Math problems


### Think & Learn like a Mathematician

To develop Xinminites who are curious, open-minded, and lifelong learners, learning experiences include hands-on activities and use of technological aids to help our students relate abstract mathematical concepts with concrete experiences to make sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications.


### Lead in Math Discoveries

To create a sense of ownership for their learning among students, our teachers adopt an inquiry-based approach for students to co-construct knowledge with peers. 

Teachers also provide students with authentic experiences where students can lead and contribute actively to learning and experience the ‘Eureka’ moment as a math learner. These experiences also allow our students to have their first-hand experience in Math as they learn to identify the application of Math in their many daily life experiences making learning meaningful. 



### Collaborate in solving Math problems

To develop metacognitive awareness and strategies, and know when and how to use the strategies, students are given opportunities in class to solve non-routine and open-ended problems, discuss their solutions, think aloud, and reflect on what they are doing. Through teamwork, our students learn to work well with others and become adaptable and resilient in solving challenging problems creatively. 



## Specialty Programmes

### Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

LSM provides early intervention to support P1 to P2 students who need extra guidance in learning Mathematics. Through this programme, students are equipped with basic numeracy skills where their confidence can be boosted in problem solving.


### E2K Math Programme

The E2K Mathematics Programme develops students Mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in Mathematical thinking through puzzles, games, and Mathematics explorations. The rich learning experiences serve to help students develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

Our teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run this enrichment programme for selected P4 and P5 students who display interest in and aptitude for Mathematics.
