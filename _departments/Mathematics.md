# Vision 
Every Xinminite, a confident problem solver. 

# Mission
Building confidence and fostering interest in mathematics.

# Key Programmes
At Xinmin Primary School, the Math Department believes every child can be a confident problem solver.  With this vision in mind, various activities are planned throughout the year to ensure that there are rich learning experiences within and beyond the classroom for our students.

### Spatial Visualisation Programme
To develop Xinminites who are curious and open-minded, this programme helps our students relate abstract mathematical concepts with concrete experiences to make sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications.

### Think Like a Mathematician 
To develop metacognitive awareness and strategies, and know when and how to use the strategies, students are given opportunities in class to solve non-routine and open-ended problems, discuss their solutions, think aloud, and reflect on what they are doing. Through teamwork, our students learn to work well with others and become adaptable and resilient in solving challenging problems creatively using this in-house learning package curated by our math teachers.

### Math Around Us
To create a sense of ownership for their learning, students are provided with authentic learning experiences in this programme where they take responsibility, lead and contribute actively to learning and experience the ‘Eureka’ moment as a math learner. This also allows our students to have their first-hand experience in Math as they learn to identify the application of Math in their many daily life experiences making learning meaningful and interesting. 


# Specialty Programmes

### Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)

LSM provides early intervention to support P1 to P3 students who need extra guidance in learning Mathematics. Through this programme, students are equipped with basic numeracy skills where their confidence can be boosted in problem solving.


### E2K Math Programme

The E2K Mathematics Programme develops students Mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in Mathematical thinking through puzzles, games, and Mathematics explorations. The rich learning experiences serve to help students develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

Our teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run this enrichment programme for selected P4 and P5 students who display interest in and aptitude for Mathematics.
