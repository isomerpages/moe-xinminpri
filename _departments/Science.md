# **Vision**

Nurturing Scientists of the Future in Every Xinminite

# **Mission**

Inculcating a lively spirit of inquiry and sense of curiosity in every Xiniminite

# **Key Programmes**

The following programmes have been specifically curated to help us realise our departments vision and mission.

### Learning Experiences @ LIVE Garden and Sensory Garden

Our LIVE (Learn and Inquire in a Vibrant Environment) Garden is a microcosm of habitats in nature and home to a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, cacti, ferns, fruit trees, and many others. It is common that students spot some ‘visitors’ such as caterpillars, butterflies and birds. The LIVE Garden also features a pond and a huge hexagonal glass tank that allows students to appreciate different species of water plants and organisms.

The Sensory Garden is designed to engage and stimulate our senses — sight, smell, taste and touch.

* Sight: The variety of colors in the leaves, flowers, and stems is visually stimulating and soothing.
* Smell: Fresh herbs and plants provide calming and invigorating scents. Students can smell some of the herbs whenever they walk past.
* Taste: Plants like the pandan and laksa are harvested and used for cooking by our canteen vendors, and others like mint are harvested and used to make tea, enriching the experience through taste.
* Touch: Students may touch and feel the textures of the plants to learn more about them.

The LIVE Garden and Sensory Gardens serve as outdoor learning spaces that support students’ investigation as the concepts learnt in books come alive through exploration and learning trails. Interactive activity corners and integration of technology within the Gardens further support Xinminites’ experiential learning, development of inquiry skills and demonstration of Thinking and Doing in Science. With teachers as the facilitators, students take ownership of their inquiry process and build on knowledge of science concepts in a familiar yet exciting setting. 

### Environmental Science Programme

Part of the Science programme is designed to be intertwined with the school’s Applied Learning Programe (GLOBE – Green Lifestyle Observed By Everyone). It introduces students to food resilience highlighted in the Singapore Green Plan, with particular focus on the “30 by 30’ goal — to build up Singapore’s agri-food industry’s capability and capacity to sustainably produce 30% of our nation’s nutritional needs by 2030. Students experience modern sustainable farming methods used locally by urban farmers and the advantages of using such technology.

### Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme

The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme designed for P4 and P5 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in science. Students develop essential 21st-century competencies through scientific inquiry processes, including resilience, resourcefulness, critical thinking, inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. The programme's inquiry-based activities and collaborative learning approaches, combined with teacher guidance, enable students to:

* strengthen their scientific thinking and reasoning abilities
* build confidence and independence in scientific inquiry
* cultivate scientific habits, attitudes, and dispositions

This comprehensive approach nurtures Xinminites to become innovative collaborators while developing their higher-order thinking skills.
