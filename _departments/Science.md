# **Vision**

Nurturing Scientists of the Future in Every Xinminite

# **Mission**

Inculcating a lively spirit of inquiry and sense of curiosity in every Xiniminite

# **Key Programmes**

The following programmes have been specifically curated to help us realise our departments vision and mission.

### **(1) Week-of-Wonder! – WOW!**

The annual Science Week-of-Wonder! promises many WOW! factors for Xinminites. It aims to invoke a sense of wonderment in students and pique their curiosity about the world around them as Lifelong Learners. Provided with the opportunity to observe and participate in hands-on experiments, students take charge of their learning to explore and discover new science concepts, as well as develop confidence in articulating new ideas, through a series of amazing and fun activities.

### **(2) Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme**

The E2K Science Programme Singapore is a science enrichment programme for P4 and P5 students who demonstrate interest and ability in science. Through scientific inquiry processes, students will develop important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. Through inquiry-based activities, collaborative learning and guidance provided by teachers, students practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes, and dispositions. This nurtures Xinminites to become Innovative Collaborators and develops their higher order thinking skills

### **(3) Individual Science Experiment Kits**

From P3 to P6, Xinminites will make use of their individual science experiment kits to develop process skills and construct understanding of science ideas. By taking ownership of their learning with the support of teachers, students will be able to discover science concepts at their own pace through experiential learning. Extension of science concepts learnt in school will also be explored with these science experiment kits.

### **(4) Learning Experiences @ LIVE Gardens**

Our LIVE (Learn and Inquire in a Vibrant Environment) Gardens are microcosms of habitats in nature and home to a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, herbs, cacti, ferns, fruit trees, and many others. It is common that students spot some ‘visitors’ such as caterpillars, butterflies and birds. The LIVE Gardens also feature a hydroponics experience centre, a tiered glass filtration system as well as a pond and a huge hexagonal glass tank that allow to appreciate different species of water plants and organisms.

The LIVE Gardens serve as outdoor learning spaces that support students’ investigation as the concepts learnt in books come alive through exploration and learning trails. Interactive activity corners and integration of technology within the LIVE Gardens further support Xinminites’ experiential learning, development of inquiry skills and demonstration of Thinking and Doing in Science. With teachers as the facilitators, students take ownership of their inquiry process and build on knowledge of science concepts in a familiar yet exciting setting.
