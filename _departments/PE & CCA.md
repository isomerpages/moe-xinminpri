# **Vision:**

Every Xinminite, a physically educated child.

# **Mission:**

Inculcating in students the Passion for Sports, the Outdoors and other Physical Activities.

### **PE Curriculum focus to develop Xinminites to be:**

·       Self-directed learners by participating in all PE activities so that they can lead a physically active lifestyle in and beyond school.

·       Active participants working collaboratively through various team activities in PE lessons, teaching pedagogies such as Sports Education and inter-class competitions

·       Confident leaders in PE lessons and sports activities as PE Monitors, Sports leaders and PE group leaders. They are given centralised and de-centralised training to assist the PE teacher during and after lessons, leading the class in warm up and cool down exercises, captaining their PE groups in intra and inter-class games.

# **PE Signature Programmes:**

### **Sports Carnival**

Sports Carnival is the major event for both students and the PE Department. It is the time where students showcase the skills they learn in PE lessons and celebrate their newly founded knowledge. This is also the platform where the classes, led by the confident PE leaders, show their class spirit, and play to the best of their abilities.

### **P5 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp**

A niche program that encapsulates the outdoor education of Xinmin Primary School. It has a evolved into a program where students also learn about a green and sustainable environment and growth mindset. The students work together to overcome challenges in an unfamiliar setting.

### **Unstructured Recess Play**

An informal setting where students keep fit, and be more physically active. This is the perfect platform for students to apply the value of lifelong learning to pursue health and physical activeness beyond the classroom.
