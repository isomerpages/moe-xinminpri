# **CCE Department**

Vision : To develop students who consistently demonstrate positive character traits and thinking skills necessary to be successful and contributing citizens.

Xinmin adopts a holistic approach to Character and Citizenship Education. The CCE curriculum “Cultivating a Life of Values and Excellence” or **CLOVE** which blends daily experiences with personal, social and academic development.

### Key Programs:

**Learning for Life Programme LLP – CLOVE (Signature Programme)**

It is our goal that the Character Education Program will assist every student in Xinmin Primary to become assets to society by acquiring the following core beliefs and character traits: **Care, Respect, Responsibility** and **Resilience**. The school believes that there is a core set of beliefs and character traits that we share. Hence much emphasis has been placed on the development of these personal qualities in learning so that students become contributing citizens in their schools, families and communities.

**Values In Action (VIA)**

VIAs planned are community-based (if SMMs permit) and real-world experiences that illustrate character traits. It is structured in such a way that it spirals from self, family to school to community.

**4 Commemorative events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day,Racial Harmony Day, National Day**）

All commemorative events go through the cycle of **exposure, experience, extension** and **reflection** stage.

At the **Exposure** stage, engaging lessons are conducted in class either during Social Studies, Art and Craft, PE or Music periods a week prior to the commemoration of the NE events. This allows students to make connections and ensures continuity in learning. It also makes learning more meaningful.

Fun and experiential activities are planned during the **Experience** stage where students develop understandings of themselves and their world through active, hands-on investigation.

During the **Extension** stage, relationships are key. It sees parents being involved in the students’ learning where they are engaged in simple activities related to the experiences that the students had gone through. Such partnerships are important as by working together, students’ learning and well-being are enhanced. Teachers are also able to link the students’ experiences at home with the activities that they do in school.

To help students develop their critical thinking skills and improve on future performance, **Reflections** done in the **Xinminites Journal** allows students to analyse what they have learned and how far they have come.

**CCE Learning Journeys (Virtual/Non Virtual if SMMs allow)**

All students go on compulsory learning journeys (Virtual/Non Virtual if SMMs allow) which are aligned to the theme identified in the CCE curriculum. The NE experiences that the students go on are important experiences that make their learning more concrete and meaningful. By visiting key installations and institutions in Singapore, students will be better able to appreciate what they have learnt in textbooks.

**Overseas Trip (Virtual/Non Virtual if SMMs allow)**

Selected Primary 4 and 5 students who are able to interact in relation to others with care, empathy and respect are invited to go on NE focused overseas trips (Virtual/Non Virtual if SMMs allow). They must have developed emerging autonomy, inter-dependence, resilience, knowledge and confident self-identities too.

**Friend of Singa (FOS)**

Friend of Singa (FOS) Primary program is an initiative by Singapore Kindness Movement to encourage students to contribute beyond themselves and to the betterment of their surroundings. 2022 sees the popular FOS Primary programme transformed into mission undertakings so that Kindness becomes an inclusive movement for all. Every student gets an opportunity to be a Friend of Singa. Students will continue to exemplify kindness through our FOS missions in 2022.

At the end of the year, students who have completed both FOS missions will be recognised as a Friend of Singa!

**CCE Conversations**

With a range of global and current issues confronting students, dedicated periods have been allocated for the discussion of contemporary issues every term. The purpose of this is to instill a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving skills to nurture our students into caring and concerned citizens who are intrinsically motivated to contribute to the success and well-being of fellow Singaporeans.

**Social Studies**

The inquiry approach is used for the learning of concepts, skills and exploration of topics in Social Studies. Students by nature are inquisitive and teaching through inquiry aims to harness this innate motivation in our students to inquire into things that interest them.

Students also embark on Project Work (PW) to develop their competencies for the 21st century. The project incorporates the process-oriented form of inquiry where it is characterised by the four aspects (sparking curiosity, gathering data, exercising reasoning and reflective thinking). Students collaborate online to gather the necessary information, make sense of the data collected and draw conclusions based on sound judgement.
