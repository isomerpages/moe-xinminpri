# **Vision:**

Every Xinminite, a reflective and discerning individual, rooted in sound values with a global mindset.

# **Mission:**

We strive to imbue a strong foundation of positive core values,
with platforms for Xinminites to display traits of our learner vision outcomes.


# **Key Programmes:**

Xinmin adopts a holistic approach to Character and Citizenship Education. The CCE curriculum “Cultivating a Life of Values and Excellence” or **CLOVE** blends daily experiences with personal, social and academic development through the following programmes:

### 4 Commemorative Events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day）

Engaging activities will be designed to provide students with meaningful opportunities to develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC) as they deepen their understanding of commemorative events. These activities aim to develop in students a strong national identity by nurturing a sense of belonging and awareness of Singapore's vulnerabilities and constraints, ultimately cultivating their will to act in improving others' lives and building our nation's future.

Xinminites will participate in customised learning experiences during four commemorative events to better appreciate Singapore's history and apply their learning as active citizens.

Through the four stages of **Exposure**, **Experience**, **Extension** and **Reflection**, our Xinminites will engage in activities that contribute to the development of our Xinminites Learner Vision statement.

At the **Exposure** stage, engaging lessons are conducted during Social Studies, Art and Craft, PE or Music periods a week before commemorating the NE events. This allows students to connect their classroom learning with the activities held during the commemorative events, ensuring continuity and making learning more meaningful.

During the **Experience** stage, fun and experiential activities are planned where students develop understanding of themselves and their world through hands-on investigations. Students apply their knowledge from the earlier stage to better understand the context of their learning environment and remain open-minded as they consider others' perspectives.

In the **Extension** stage, parents enhance their children's learning through specially designed activities that promote parent-child interactions. Such partnerships are vital. By working together, both parents and Xinminites will better appreciate the essence of the four commemorative events, particularly in Singapore's rapidly changing landscape. Teachers can also link students' experiences at home with school activities.

To help students develop critical thinking skills and improve future performance, they will **reflect** on their learning in relation to the theme. This process will prepare them to become future-ready citizens.

### CCE Cohort Learning Journeys (LJ)

Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs) provide Xinminites with opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity through arts, culture and heritage. These LJs have been specially curated for students' formative years to develop citizenship dispositions and national identity. The experiences students gain through these journeys make their learning more concrete and meaningful. Through visits to key installations and institutions in Singapore, students demonstrate their life-long learner traits and develop a deeper appreciation of their textbook learning in real-world contexts.



### Values In Action (VIA)

Values in Action (VIA) programmes provide authentic opportunities for students to make responsible choices for themselves and others. When faced with challenges in decision-making, students need to demonstrate open-mindedness, consider different perspectives, and make choices that align with school core values and social vision.
In Xinmin, VIA programmes are designed around community-based and real-world experiences that enhance the development of positive character traits. The programme structure follows a spiral progression, beginning with self-awareness, extending to family engagement, and expanding to school and community involvement.

### **4 Commemorative Events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day,Racial Harmony Day, National Day**）

Our Xinminites will go through the customised learning experiences during the 4 commemorative events to better appreciate the Singapore history and apply their learning to contribute as active citizens.

Using the 4 stages of Exposure. Experience, Extension and Reflection, our Xinminites will be engaged in these activities which contribute to the development of our Xinminites Learner Vision statement.

At the **Exposure** stage, engaging lessons are conducted in class either during Social Studies, Art and Craft, PE or Music periods a week prior to the commemoration of the NE events. This allows students to make connections to what they have been learning in their lessons with the activities held on the day of the commemorative events. This ensures continuity in learning and makes learning more meaningful.

Fun and experiential activities are planned during the **Experience** stage where students develop understandings of themselves and their world through hands-on investigations. Students also leverage on their knowledge at the earlier stage to better understand the context of their learning environment and open their mind as they listen to others’ perspectives.

During the **Extension** stage, parents will be roped in to enhance in the students’ learning through specially designed learning that promotes parent-child interactions. Such partnerships are important. By working together, both parents and our Xinminites will better appreciate the essence of the 4 commemorative events, especially in the rapid changing landscape like Singapore. Teachers are also able to link the students’ experiences at home with the activities that they do in school.

To help students develop their critical thinking skills and improve on future performance, students will reflect what they have learnt in relation to the theme. This will develop them to become future-ready citizens for tomorrow.

### **CCE Cohort Learning Journeys (LJ)**

Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs) provide Xinminites with opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity through the arts, culture and heritage. These cohort LJs have been specially curated for students’ formative years for the development of citizenship dispositions and national identity. These LJ experiences that the students go through are important experiences that make their learning more concrete and meaningful. By visiting key installations and institutions in Singapore, students are given the platforms to display their life-long learner traits and will be better able to appreciate and relate to what they have learnt in textbooks.

### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

Primary 1 and 2 Xinminites participate in the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) during curriculum hours. Through PAL, students engage in diverse and enjoyable learning experiences that promote their holistic development across physical, cognitive, social, aesthetic and moral domains. Students develop socio-emotional competencies, including respect for others and responsible decision-making skills. The PAL modules are designed to build students' confidence, nurture their curiosity, cultivate positive learning attitudes, and enhance their appreciation for group experiences and teamwork.


###  CCE Conversations

In response to the range of global issues confronting students, dedicated periods are allocated each term for discussions of contemporary topics. These sessions aim to build a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Through such discussions, students develop into caring and concerned citizens who are intrinsically motivated to contribute to the success and well-being of fellow Singaporeans.
