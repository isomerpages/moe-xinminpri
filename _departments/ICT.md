### P3 Coding Programme

**Objective:**

*   To develop basic coding skills.
*   To instill interest in coding.

This programme is catered to all Primary 3 students. After 7 sessions, each student will be able to create a simple game of their own on Scratch. This 10.5-hour programme is conducted during Modular CCA sessions.

Students are taught to create animation through a block of codes. Lessons typically start with the instructor teaching them how to build a block of codes that are required for the day. Time is given for students to explore the codes for themselves and modify them to form the animation that they want.

Students will be trained to exercise sequential thinking as they need to know the sequence of the codes to achieve the figures that they want. Students will develop their visualisation skills as they need to first visualise what they want to create. There are opportunities for students to display creativity when they modify their codes.

The opportunity to display creativity injects a high level of interest and engagement among students. The response from students  thus far has been positive.
